Bill,

I want to apologize for not reaching out sooner. I have been traveling for the last 3 weeks and have played catch up this week. I want to follow up on a few items as I am leaving on vacation tomorrow Monday April 8 for a week. I will be back in the office on Monday April 15.

I issued a payment today for the balance of the emergency mitigation work. As I understand it, the total approved cost is $412,230.91. We issued an advance payment at the end of February totaling $200,000. Therefore, the balance due totals $212,230.91. This is the total of the payment I have requested. I would expect you should have it mid-week.

I had a conversation with Adam about a week ago about the water service line for the sprinkler system. He asked that I clarify the coverage for this item. Water supply lines buried in the ground outside the building are not covered because they are not part of the building. We insure the building but do not insure the land.

2. Property Not Covered

Covered Property does not include:

d. Bridges, roadways, walks, patios or other paved surfaces;

m. Underground pipes, flues or drains;

So, regarding the water supply under the driveway, the policy does not provide coverage for replacement of the failed water line. We would pick up the repair / replacement of the water line/sprinkler system when it enters the building. I would add, that there were some other areas in the back warehouse where there was water damage to tile floors, etc. If you would like to take the money for those repairs and apply it to the repair of the failed water line I have no issue with that possibility. We would have to get all the figures for the repair of the water line and for the repair of the water damage you may decide not to repair and see if there are enough funds to cover the water line repair or if these funds will only cover a portion of the repair. I defer to Tom Celosky to work out these details with Servpro. I will review all the details discuss it with you once the information has been compiled. Should you experience a claims emergency during my absence next week, please contact my manager, Nicole Brasser at 1-800-242-7666 x 1811 or by email at nbrasser@acuity.com.

Please let me know if you have any questions and we can discuss them upon my return.

Best regards,

Dave Jostes

Bill, Mark,

As you know, I issued a payment to American Express Company totaling $29,984.00 a couple weeks ago. The balance of the items remain unpaid. I have issued a payment today for $1000. This covers the antifatigue mats, the Jergens items and the cardboard. I rounded the payment up to an even thousand to cover any small misc. items. Please let me know if this addresses all the outstanding contents items. (with the exception of repackaging the salvaged blankets) Please send an invoice for the repackaging at your convenience.

Payment has been mailed to your attention Bill.

Best regards,

Dave Jostes
