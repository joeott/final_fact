## G. Missouri Property And Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Coverage Limitations

1. Subject to the provisions of the Missouri Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act (to be referred to as the Act), if we are a member of the Missouri Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (to be referred to as the Association), the Association will pay claims covered under the Act if we become insolvent.
2. The Act contains various exclusions, conditions and limitations that govern a claimant's eligibility to collect payment from the Association and affect the amount of any payment. The following limitations apply, subject to all other provisions of the Act:
a. Claims covered by the Association do not include a claim by or against an insured of an insolvent insurer, if the insured has a net worth of more than $\$ 25$ million on the later of the end of the insured's most recent fiscal year or the December thirtyfirst of the year next preceding the date the insurer becomes insolvent, provided that an insured's net worth on such date shall be deemed to include the aggregate net worth of the insured and all of its affiliates as calculated on a consolidated basis.
b. Payments made by the Association for covered claims will include only that amount of each claim which is less than $\$ 300,000$.
However, the Association will not:
(1) Pay an amount in excess of the applicable Limit of Insurance of the policy from which a claim arises; or
(2) Return to an insured any unearned premium in excess of $\$ 25,000$.
These limitations have no effect on the coverage we will provide under this policy.
H. For the Commercial Property Coverage Part, the following exclusion and related provisions are added to Paragraph B2 Exclusions in the Causes Of Loss Forms and to any Coverage Form or policy to which a Causes Of Loss Form is not attached:
3. We will not pay for loss or damage arising out of any act an insured commits or conspires to commit with the intent to cause
a loss.
In the event of such loss, no insured is entitled to coverage, even insureds who did not commit or conspire to commit the act causing the loss.
4. However, this exclusion will not apply to deny coverage to an innocent co-insured who did not cooperate in or contribute to the creation of the loss, provided the loss is otherwise covered under this Coverage Part and the loss arose out of domestic violence. Such coverage will be provided only if the innocent co-insured files a police report and completes a sworn affidavit indicating both:
a. The cause of the loss; and
b. A pledge to cooperate in any criminal prosecution of the person committing the act causing the loss.
5. If we pay a claim pursuant to paragraph I 2 above, our payment to the innocent co-insured will be limited to that insured's ownership interest in the property as reduced by any payment to a mortgagee or other secured interest; however, we shall not be required to make any subsequent payment for any loss for which the innocent co-insured has received payment. In no event will we pay more than the Limit of Insurance.
I. The following is added to the Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us Loss Condition:
If we pay an innocent co-insured for loss arising out of an act of domestic violence by another insured, the rights of the innocent co-insured to recover damages from the abuser are transferred to us to the extent of our payment. Following the loss, the innocent co-insured may not waive such right to recover against the abuser.
J. The following is added with respect to the Additional Coverages of Debris Removal and Pollutant Clean Up And Removal, and relates only to the requirement to report expenses to us within 180 days of the specified occurrence:
If you fail to report the expenses to us within the 180-day time frame, such failure will not invalidate a claim under Debris Removal or Pollutant Clean Up And Removal unless such failure operates to prejudice our rights.
K. When the Replacement Cost Optional Coverage in the Commercial Property Coverage Part applies, the following is added with respect to these provisions and relates only to the requirement to notify us of your intent to submit an additional claim (for the difference between the actual cash value and replacement cost) within 180 days after the loss or damage
