inspected building with insured yesterday 5pm
$* * * * *$
Upon arriving on site I made contact with the adjacent building manager and plumbers from drain surgeons who were assessing the water that was fountaining out of the parking lot between their building and the insureds building

- I made contact with mark inside and he came out as well.
- drain surgeons went into the street and turned off the valve which stopped the water. It was determined the line was the fire suppressant line that feeds our insureds building. our insured paid the invoice $* * * *$

Findings: Per video insured showed from day prior water was just seeping from the ground near his building in the area of the fire suppressant area at the exterior of the building/ based on the large blowout in the the parking lot it and snow and ice on the building and inside around the area of the roof collapse it appears over night the line giesered onto the roof and froze causing a large amount of weight which then caused the roof to collapse until the whole filled with water and started to bubble rather than continue geisering.

## ***********

Damages

- Roof: Flat/TPO roof with metal ceiling and pearling/ A large section of the roof collapsed into the building to the ground. This damaged electrical and fire suppressant lines.
- Water: There was water on the concrete floors throughout however the warehouse is mostly concrete and does not appear to have much is any actual water damge. there was still some puddling.
- Contents: This is mostly cardboard stock on pallets / and some customer product that was being reboxed into nice boxing which is what our insured does/ there was some directly under the collapse area that is damage and wet, everything else in building is mostly on pallets and does not appears damaged. Humidity is not an issue at this time.
- I advised insured they could continue to move undamaged product to other areas of the building and they will also stage any damaged contents to the corner of the warehouse for further inspection but only items they can safely get to.
- I advised he may want to have the electrician come Monday to assist with making sure power is off to the area of concern and for some reason the office area electric heater is not turning on and so he will see about getting that working to prevent any issues in the small office area as there is a kitchen and bathroom area, they did have space heater running for now to prevent issues.

Inspected loss with insd manager Mark Gray, BC Tom Celosky, SE Joseph Kraus of EFI, Mitigation contractor Kevin Thoole of Servpro of St Louis.
Mitigation is mostly complete. 100,000sf of warehouse space with a small area of offices inside the warehouse. Roof collapsed breaking springler system, plumbing lines, electric lines, etc.
All floors in the entire building had to be extracted and cleaned. Officed had to be extracted, cleaned and dried. some demolition was necessary.
the collapsed roof was removed for safety reasons, temporary walls were installed around the area with the missing roof so that the warehouse can be used and heated.
Exterior of walls was weather proofed and roof was temped in to keep water in the area with the missing roof. A swimming pool is being installed in this area with a pump to collect the rain water and remove it from the building.
SE was making a follow up inspection of the trusses and roof system. He will produce repair drawings and recommendations.

Page 10 of 17

Servpro will be the GC on the job. They will work with BC Celosky to reach an agreement on the cost of the repair.

Scope of repair is agreed at this time.
There is a large amount of asbestos tile, plaster, mastic, drywall in the building that was affected by water. This will require mitigation. We are waiting for that bid.
Will request reserve when we get the Rough Order of Magnitude from Tom Celosky.

No business interruption at this time. Office may need to be moved to do repairs but should not affect production.

There are a group of contents that must be inventoried. Servpro will inventory them and i will work with insd to get values.

# INVESTIGATE (AGCY/INSD VIEWABLE) 

RIVERDALE PACKAGING
Received rough order of magnitude from building consultant Tom Celosky of Newman Construction Consulting. ROM includes mitigation and all building repairs known at this time.
Estimated Mitigation cost $\$ 300 \mathrm{~K}$
Estimated building repair cost $\$ 1 \mathrm{M}$

Rom also includes potential code upgrades which have been valued at approximately $\$ 3.2 \mathrm{M}$ if they are enforced. The policy only provides $\$ 60 \mathrm{~K}$ in coder upgrade coverage between the main policy and the Acuity Advantages endorsement.
Mitigation completed. Temporary walls and roof repairs are complete. Mitigation contractor installed a kids pool in the middle of the open roof area to collect any precipitation while the building is being repaired. Tarps will direct water into the pool and a pump will pump water out through a window in the building. This will prevent water from entering the building while waiting for the bar joists to arrive. This will likely be 6-8 weeks from when they are ordered.

Servpro provided a contents list including all the contents damaged in the loss and identified by the insd rep Marc Gray.
There were many items Marc left of the list advising that they could be disposed of and had no value.
The main content loss involved boxes of blankets packaged for American Express.
There were about 2400 of these items. They cost approximately $\$ 38$ per item.
initially SP reported that 1700 were affected. This would total about $\$ 64,000$.
Insd Bill Nottke reached out and advised the thought they could save many of these items by repackaging them. They would custom make the boxes and rewrap them in plastic. He said this would likely cost a few thousand dollars and should save about $\$ 20,000$. I advised them to proceed with this plan.

He originally advised 11 trusses to the east were deflected at the beam connection but we would weld on some additional angle iron to repair. The report indicates replacement of these 11 trusses therefore increasing the repair area by $100 \%$.

REPAIR STATUS / PERMITS / CODE

Permits: The city requires us to get a general building permit, with this we are also required to get architectural drawings for the proposed repairs. We are in the process of getting the drawings now. I have sent the engineering report to them as well. Once we have the general, all repairs that do not fall under the general i.e. electrical, plumbing, mechanical and suppression system are required by the city to get their own permit.
Code issues: We will find out more once we have our initial inspection which the city will not perform until they have the drawings.
Any requirements that are not addressed under the general scope of work to be performed due to the loss we won't know until the individual inspectors sign off on the plans.
Failed waterline: We are in the process of getting bids to perform work and this will be priority number one, this repair will require permits. Once this is fixed it is possible the city will want a temporary solution to areas of the building where the main damaged lines are and will have to splice into other lines temporarily. I am working with the insured on this matter for the outside repairs, the initial bid I received was not approved by the insured. I will have more bids and information on this matter by the end of the week.

Called insd to discuss payments, bills, etc. He mentioned that the purchaser wanted to take over the claim. I began to discuss this and he asked if we could include his broker in the call. I assumed he meant his insurance broker.

I made a call to both parties insd and his broker Bob Flynn.
He has sold the building and the purchaser wants to take over the claim. I told both that I am not inclined to accept any assignment and I believe the policy excludes assignment. I explained how the policy would address the claim by paying ACV to the insd and he is free to pass this on to the purchaser. Turns out this was his real estate broker.

He stated they simply wanted the funds to repair the property. I advised them both that we had an agreed cost of repair with a contractor and the only potential by letting the purchaser work with us is that they would ask for more money. Otherwise, the insd could simply pass the insurance proceeds to the purchaser. The broker assured me that they had no intention of asking for more money.
Broker asked me to speak with the purchaser regarding the claim. I advised I would do so. The purchaser would call me.

Purchaser of insd building called me to discuss.
Michael of All States called.
He advised they were purchasing the building, they had gone to their counsel and confirmed that the policy did not prohibit assignment they also checked and the state of MO did not prohibit assignment. He advised that they had the assignment and intended to take the claim over. He asked me to accept the assignment as they could proceed with it either way and this would simplify the process.
I told him that I would not accept the assignment. There is no benefit to us accepting the assignment. There is only downside. We already adjusted the claim we have contractors, agreed estimates, etc. They are not our insured, therefore I would never agreed to assignment. I told him there should be no issue as insd has agreed to pay any proceeds to them for the claim. He advised that their General Contractors have not seen the loss. I stopped him and said that is the problem. You intend to restart the process and I am not willing to do this. We briefly discussed suit and I told him to send the information on the sale and the assignment and I would send to our counsel to review. I emailed him at michael@allstateseg.com.
