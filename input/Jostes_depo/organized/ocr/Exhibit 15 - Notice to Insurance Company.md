Not sure what you are requesting us to do. Sounds like more than we agreed to last week, when we were just sending in the Notice to Acuity that you drafted for us. I see you copied Bill Nottke on your email. I suspect he will not take kindly to the message as his biggest worry is that you will try to get him more and more involved with this. Anyway I have been tied up for the last 4 hours today 2:30 to 6:30 pm. We can talk tomorrow morning.

Michael and Javier, we have your signed documents as of yesterday afternoon. Just lacking your money at this point. Hopefully we can get this closed today. Can you check with your bank that was to send the wire transfer and ask them for an update?
