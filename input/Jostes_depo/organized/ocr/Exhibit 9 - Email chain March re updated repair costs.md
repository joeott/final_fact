Dave- Just wanted to bring this to your attention and keep us all on the same page.

It appears the city is requiring Architectural drawings.

It is my impression based on the call I had with Adam today, and the information he read to me from the city, that only the affected area will need to be drawn, not the entire building.

I have recommended that ServPro circle in Joe Kraus with EFI and have him get involved to help with the determining the city requirements, and possible complete the drawings if appropriate.

I have also made it clear anything required outside of the building for the underground and Fire Suppression system will not be included in the claimed event, and we have to break out that portion.

Good Morning Dave,
Here is a brief update on where we currently stand:

Permits: The city requires us to get a general building permit, with this we are also required to get architectural drawings for the proposed repairs. We are in the process of getting the drawings now. I have sent the engineering report to them as well. Once we have the general, all repairs that do not fall under the general i.e. electrical, plumbing, mechanical and suppression system are required by the city to get their own permit.

Code issues: We will find out more once we have our initial inspection which the city will not perform until they have the drawings.
Any requirements that are not addressed under the general scope of work to be performed due to the loss we won't know until the individual inspectors sign off on the plans.

Failed waterline: We are in the process of getting bids to perform work and this will be priority number one, this repair will require permits. Once this is fixed it is possible the city will want a temporary solution to areas of the building where the main damaged lines are and will have to

Page 3 of 8

splice into other lines temporarily. I am working with the insured on this matter for the outside repairs, the initial bid I received was not approved by the insured. I will have more bids and information on this matter by the end of the week.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you

All,

Do we have any information on the permit, code issues, etc.?

Also has there been any discussion about the failed water line? Any idea when it will be repaired?

Best regards,

Good Morning -

We have received and I have reviewed the ESI Engineering report. Please find the attached PDF of the ESI Engineering report dated 2/29/24. It appears the recommendation has changed from our onsite discussion. Instead of repairing in place bar joist to the East of the ceiling hole, they are now being replaced.

This will increase the foot print of the roof portion repairs. Please review the information and use this for the bid proposals going forward for but not limited to:

- Roofing
- Structural Steel
- Electrical

Plumbing

HVAC

Fire Suppression

Please provide an update on the Repairs estimate and when we can expect to receive it, onsite progress for other areas of repairs and Abatement.

Please also advise when we can expect to receive the revised Mitigation, which should include ALL in information as Mitigation should be complete.

Morning -

I have reviewed the abatement proposal and am in agreement with the scope of work and value associated.

Please note this is a Not to Exceed number in theory, should scope or costs change I will require a heads up prior to work completed.

Actual accounting will be requested once completed to review scope and costs.

Understood, Thank you for info, I also have attached the estimate from Crossroads. Let me know if you have questions or concerns.

Anything to-do with contents will be on contents.

Mitigation is just that.

Repairs, obvious.

You should have 3 categories of work.

I followed up with the Engineer last week, we are waiting on his response and report.

But his verbal was replacing structural steel where missing, and repairs to structural steel around the missing.

Meaning the next bay(3) of steel around the whole in the ceiling needs to be repaired. I believe using metal materials and welding back into place.

Post abatement in the office area can and should be written in Xactimate, not bids.

Bids are for specialty contractors and the warehouse.

Good morning Tom

Here is what I have so far,

Asbesto- Cross roads has made proper notice to the city. We are still waiting on the estimate, I just reached out to them today and will have their estimate later today or Monday at the latest.

Mit - Still waiting on receiving invoices from subs. Will pack out and relocation of insured be on mit or recon? I had a crew start on packing out the unoccupied areas of the office. We will be setting up the water intrusion catch basin and pump system, Monday or Tuesday of next week. I hope to have something for you early next week in regards to where the bill is at.

Repairs - Currently receiving bids, was curious if I can get the engineers report when available for the structural repairs needed? This way bids can be based on his recommendations. Unfortunately until Crossroads completes the office area. I won't be able to have any accurate bids. Will have to wait and see the extent of their abatement. I did communicate with the insured that he will be expected to cover all exterior

fire suppression system damage and packing lot repairs.
Hope you have a good weekend!
