## 1. Insuring Agreement

We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for any negligent act, error or omission to which this insurance does not apply. We may at our discretion investigate any negligent act, error or omission and settle any claim or suit that may result. But:
(1) The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in Section III - Limits of Insurance; and
(2) Our right and duty to defend ends when we have used up the applicable Limit of Insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements.
No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided for under Supplementary Payments - Printers' Errors and Omissions Liability.

## 2. Exclusions

This insurance does not apply to:
a. Bodily injury, property damage, personal and advertising injury.

(b) Claim or suit by or on behalf of a governmental authority for damages because of testing for, monitoring, cleaning up, removing, containing, treating, detoxifying or neutralizing, or in any way responding to or assessing the effects of pollutants.

## Duties in the Event of a Negligent Act, Error, Omission, Claim or Suit

## Other Insurance

If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under this endorsement, our obligations are limited as follows:

## a. Primary Insurance

This insurance is primary. Our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in b below.

## b. Method of Sharing

If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable Limit of Insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first.
If any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable Limit of Insurance to the total applicable Limits of Insurance of all insurers.
5. The following Condition is added:

## Retraction

You must make a good faith effort to promptly retract or correct any material which is untrue or which has been printed through your error or mistake or through the error or mistake of anyone working on your behalf.

a. "Printing services" means the printing, typesetting or layout of material and may include providing technical guidance in the selection of the appropriate colors, inks, paper or other items affecting the appearance, but not the content, of the material being printed. Printing services does not include exercising editorial control over the content of the material being printed or the collection or mathematical manipulation of data.
b. "Suit" means a civil proceeding in which damages because of any negligent act, error or omission to which this insurance applies are alleged. Suit includes:
(1) An arbitration proceeding in which such damages are claimed and to which the insured must submit or does submit with our consent; or
