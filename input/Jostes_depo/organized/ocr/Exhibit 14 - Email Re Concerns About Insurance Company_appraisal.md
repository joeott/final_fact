I dropped all FedEx docs this morning.
I have also wired funds. My partner is sending the last 500k in the morning since he can only wire 500k at a time from Chase. He is in Hawaii for the summer(no branches there)

The seller has executed all of the closing documents and has left them at the Title Company. I am tied up for the next few hours, but I will forward to you a copy of the executed documents later this afternoon. Could you please send me copies of documents which have been executed by the purchaser. Just a reminder that you do need to overnight the deed and any other documents that need to be notarized to the title company for delivery tomorrow. Are you still in a position to close tomorrow?

for next day delivery (plus any other documents the title company needs from you). Please note that the Deed has to be notarized.

Seller will sign all of these documents at the title company on Monday. I will email you copies of the Seller signed documents on Monday and if you could email me copies of the Buyer signed documents on Monday that would be great. Please be sure to wire in the funds needed to close.

Subject: Followup per call 6.6.2024 / appraisal for demand document

Mr. Brian C. West, Esq.,

Good morning, I hope this message finds you well. As discussed yesterday, June 6, 2024 we have concerns the insurance company (Acuity) may attempt to not accept our valid assignment of claim. In an abundance of caution, in order to avoid any and all litigation with Acuity, we want to

Page 5 of 7

take the simple step of requesting your client, Riverdale Packaging Corporation, invoke appraisal to resolve the claim. Appraisal is a provision intended to be utilized to avoid legal disputes as it is a form of alternative dispute resolution. The appraisal provision can be found in the policy on page 28 of 301 of the PDF, with a footer labeling of "page 4 of 16 " in the property insurance section.

The appraisal provision reads as follows:

# 2. Appraisal 

If we and you disagree on the value of the
property or the amount of loss, either may
make written demand for an appraisal of the
loss. In this event, each party will select a
competent and impartial appraiser. The two
appraisers will select an umpire. If they
cannot agree, either may request that
selection be made by a judge of a court
having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state
separately the value of the property and
amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will
submit their differences to the umpire. A
decision agreed to by any two will be
binding. Each party will:
a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal
and umpire equally.
If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our
right to deny the claim.

The appraisal process requires uninvolved, disinterested, third-parties set the value of loss which closes the claim and makes the amount set final and binding. As discussed, we believe the

Page 6 of 7

insurer owes for a full roof replacement which would alleviate considerable financial burdens we will face in reconstructing and repairing the building. We just want the insurance company to pay for what they actually owe.

You will note in the demand for appraisal document, we identify the appraiser as Ron Williamson, a seasoned and well respected, national appraiser.

We request this document be signed and submitted to the insurance company by your client at closing as we anticipate Acuity denying the valid assignment, which we would rather not challenge. We would rather allow an appraisal panel set the amount of loss and close the claim. I want to again reiterate per our call, we just want a simple, smooth transaction. We are antilitigation that is why we propose this method of resolution. With that stated, we still want the insurer to pay for what they owe in relation to the loss sustained which they have left out critical structural components of the repair and ISO board (insulation board).

We will sit in the shoes of your client in bearing all costs associated with the appraisal as we have a valid binding assignment between our companies upon the execution of the PSA.

I tried to make this document as simple as possible (one page) and have attached a PDF and word doc for the ease of editing.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
