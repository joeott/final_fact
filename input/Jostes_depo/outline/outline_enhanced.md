# **CROSS-EXAMINATION TARGET FACTS: Insurance Adjuster/Corporate Representative (30(b)(6))**

### **I. Knowledge of Missouri Law at Time of Denial**

- **Assignment Law**: Did adjuster/company know Missouri permits post-loss assignments despite anti-assignment clauses?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory responses showing denial based solely on anti-assignment clause]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment agreement establishing post-loss timing]**

- **Legal Research**: What legal research was conducted before denying the assigned claim? (None = powerful evidence)
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing timeline of events but no legal research notation]**

- **Training/Guidelines**: Does company have written policies on honoring post-loss assignments? Were they followed?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatories request policy documents on assignment handling]**

- **Prior Experience**: Has company honored other post-loss assignments in Missouri? Why treat this one differently?
  - **[EXHIBIT 2 - Acuity responses to Wombat RFP]**

### **II. Factual Basis for Denial (Suspicion vs. Facts)**

- **Concrete Evidence**: What specific facts (not suspicions) supported the denial decision?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory Answer admitting denial based solely on policy anti-assignment clause]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log entries showing investigation timeline]**

- **Investigation Adequacy**: What investigation was done before denying? Documents reviewed? Witnesses interviewed?
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log documenting claim activities but no investigation of assignment validity]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 5 - January 23 email showing initial cooperative investigation of loss itself]**

- **Ignored Evidence**: What evidence of coverage existed that adjuster failed to consider or acknowledge?
  - **[EXHIBIT 7 - Initial Reserve Report stating "Coverage Issues: None at this time"]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 6 - Newman Report with $4.5M repair estimate showing substantial covered damage]**

- **Timeline**: When did company receive assignment notice? When did payments stop? What triggered the stoppage?
  - **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment notice dated June 2024]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing payment activity through May 2024, then stoppage]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 10 - April 2024 broker email showing normal claim handling before assignment]**

### **III. Decision-Making Process**

- **Who Decided**: Identify all persons involved in denial decision (adjuster, supervisor, legal department, corporate policy)
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Identifies Dave Jostes as Senior Property Claims Specialist handling claim]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 7 - Nicole Brasser (Property Claims Manager) copied on reserve report]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing internal communications between adjusters]**

- **Written Justification**: Any internal memo, email, or claims note documenting reasons for denial?
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log entries - check for denial justification notes]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 11 - AmEx memo showing internal communications on coverage positions]**

- **Legal Consultation**: Did company consult attorney about assignment validity? If yes, what was advice? (Privilege waiver issue)
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory responses should reveal legal consultations if any]**

- **Corporate Policy**: Was denial based on blanket policy rather than case-specific analysis?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Request for written policies on assignments]**

### **IV. Policy Interpretation Issues**

- **"Occurrence" Definition**: How did adjuster define "occurrence"? What policy language or case law supported that interpretation?
  - **[EXHIBIT 3 - Policy Loss Conditions showing occurrence definitions]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 7 - Reserve report treating collapse as covered occurrence]**

- **"Property of Others" Coverage**: Did adjuster review policy provisions covering property not owned by insured? Why denied?
  - **[EXHIBIT 3 - Policy provisions on covered property]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 11 - Outside Pipe - Policy language on property not covered]**

- **Ambiguity Claims**: If adjuster claims policy was "ambiguous," what made it ambiguous? Any Missouri case law supporting that position?
  - **[EXHIBIT 2 - Acuity responses may address policy interpretation]**

- **Contrary Interpretation**: Was adjuster aware Missouri construes ambiguities against insurer? Did that affect decision?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatories exploring Acuity's knowledge of Missouri law]**

### **V. Willfulness and Lack of Reasonable Cause**

- **Open Question Claim**: Does company contend assignment validity was "open question"? What made it open if majority rule and treatises say otherwise?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Acuity's legal position on assignment validity]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 17 - Complaint showing Acuity's declaratory judgment pleadings]**

- **Shifting Explanations**: Has company's stated reason for denial changed over time? (Pre-suit vs. in pleadings vs. at deposition)
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory answers stating current position]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 17 - Complaint articulating legal grounds]**
  - **[Compare to EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log entries documenting contemporaneous reasoning]**

- **Persistence After Notice**: After being informed of Missouri law on assignments, did company maintain denial? Why?
  - **[EXHIBIT 14 - Concerns about insurance company behavior, appraisal demands]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 15 & 16 - Notices to insurance company showing attempts to resolve]**

- **Financial Motive**: Any evidence company denied to avoid payment rather than based on legitimate coverage question?
  - **[EXHIBIT 7 - Initial reserve $1,460,000 vs. EXHIBIT 6 - Actual estimate $4,517,112.50 - massive overage]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 10 - April 2024 email showing claim proceeding normally until assignment]**

### **VI. Industry Standards and Practices**

- **Standard Practice**: What do most insurers do when presented with post-loss assignment in Missouri?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatories request examples of similar claims]**

- **Claims Manual**: Does company's own claims handling manual address assignments? What does it say?
  - **[EXHIBIT 2 - Acuity RFP responses may address standard procedures]**

- **Past Claims**: In similar claims (assigned property loss), has company honored the assignment? Consistency?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Request for comparable claim examples]**

- **Reasonableness Test**: Would a reasonable insurer, with knowledge of Missouri law and these facts, have denied this claim?
  - **[EXHIBIT 7 - "Coverage Issues: None" determination shows unreasonableness of later denial]**

### **VII. Damages and Conduct After Suit Filed**

- **Post-Suit Position**: Has company maintained its denial position throughout litigation despite adverse legal authority?
  - **[EXHIBIT 17 - Complaint showing Acuity's declaratory judgment action]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 2 - Acuity's responses in discovery]**

- **Settlement Discussions**: Any good-faith attempt to re-evaluate claim after lawsuit filed?
  - **[EXHIBIT 14 - Communications showing concerns about insurance company conduct]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 15 & 16 - Appraisal notices suggesting alternative resolution attempts]**

- **Qureshi Principle**: Company aware Missouri allows consideration of conduct through trial in vexatious refusal analysis?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatories exploring Acuity's knowledge of Missouri bad faith law]**

### **VIII. Impeachment Opportunities (From Deposition)**

- **Contradictory Statements**: Compare deposition testimony to prior written denials, interrogatory answers, or claim notes
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory answers to compare against testimony]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log contemporaneous notes vs. later explanations]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 8 vs. EXHIBIT 9 - Fire suppression coverage contradiction]**

- **Ignorance Admissions**: "I didn't research Missouri law" / "I relied on general policy clause" / "I assumed assignment was invalid"
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Responses showing limited legal research or analysis]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing no legal research notation]**

- **No Documentation**: Lack of written analysis supporting denial = arbitrary decision
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log - look for absence of denial analysis memo]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 11 - Internal memos on other coverage issues but not assignment]**

- **Admission of Error**: Any acknowledgment (even qualified) that position may have been wrong
  - **[Discovery responses may contain qualified admissions]**

---

### **STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES**

1. **Establish no factual basis** for denial (suspicion ≠ reasonable cause per *DeWitt*)
   - **[EXHIBIT 7 - "Coverage Issues: None" proves initial coverage determination]**
   - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Denial based solely on policy clause, not facts]**

2. **Lock in legal ignorance** (didn't research Missouri's majority-rule assignment law)
   - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing no legal research activity]**

3. **Prove willfulness** (continued denial despite clear legal authority)
   - **[EXHIBIT 14, 15, 16 - Multiple notices and attempts at resolution ignored]**

4. **Show unreasonableness** (no prudent insurer would have denied under these facts/law)
   - **[EXHIBIT 7 + EXHIBIT 6 - Large covered loss initially recognized]**
   - **[EXHIBIT 10 - Normal claim handling until assignment]**

5. **Build jury narrative** (company chose profit over paying valid claim)
   - **[EXHIBIT 7 - $1.46M reserve vs. EXHIBIT 6 - $4.5M actual cost = motive]**

---

### **KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK (Leading Format)**

- You stopped payment after receiving the assignment notice, correct?
  - **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment notice timing + EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log payment cessation]**

- You never researched whether Missouri law permits post-loss assignments, did you?
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing no legal research notation]**

- You're not aware of any Missouri case saying anti-assignment clauses bar post-loss assignments, are you?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory responses on legal authority]**

- The company has no written analysis explaining why this assignment was invalid, correct?
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log; EXHIBIT 11 - Internal memos]**

- Your only basis for denial was the policy's anti-assignment clause, wasn't it?
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory Answer explicitly stating this basis]**

- You didn't investigate whether the loss actually occurred as claimed, did you?
  - **[EXHIBIT 5, 6 - Investigation focused on loss scope, not validity]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 7 - "Coverage Issues: None" shows loss validity never questioned]**

- A reasonable insurer would have researched the law before denying a $[amount] claim, wouldn't it?
  - **[EXHIBIT 6 - $4,517,112.50 total estimate establishes claim value]**

---

**This condensed outline targets the core elements needed to prove vexatious refusal under §375.420: (1) no reasonable factual basis, (2) no reasonable legal basis, (3) willful disregard of clearly established law, and (4) inadequate investigation—all supported by Missouri precedent (*DeWitt*, *Qureshi*, *Nooter*, *Pemiscot*).**

# **CROSS-EXAMINATION OUTLINE: DAVE JOSTES**
## **Senior Property Claims Specialist, Acuity Insurance**

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**WITNESS TYPE:** Corporate Representative / Fact Witness (Senior Property Claims Specialist)
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Identifies Jostes's role and authority]**

**PRIMARY STRATEGIC GOALS:**
1. Establish Jostes had no factual basis to deny the assigned claim (only relied on policy language)
   - **[EXHIBIT 1, EXHIBIT 7 - Supporting evidence]**
2. Prove Jostes never researched Missouri law on post-loss assignments before denying claim
   - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing no research activity]**
3. Demonstrate willful refusal to pay despite clear legal authority and ongoing investigation
   - **[EXHIBITS 14-16 - Multiple notices ignored]**
4. Expose inadequate investigation and arbitrary decision-making
   - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log; EXHIBIT 10 - Normal handling until assignment]**
5. Show financial motive to deny rather than legitimate coverage concerns
   - **[EXHIBIT 6 vs. EXHIBIT 7 - Cost overrun motive]**

**KEY VULNERABILITIES:**
- Admitted in interrogatories that denial was based solely on anti-assignment clause
  - **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory Answer]**
- No legal research conducted on Missouri assignment law before denial
  - **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log]**
- Continued paying claim for months, then abruptly stopped upon assignment notice
  - **[EXHIBIT 10 - April status; EXHIBIT 13 - June assignment; EXHIBIT 4 - Payment cessation]**
- Initial reserves set at $1,460,000 - demonstrating coverage was never in doubt
  - **[EXHIBIT 7 - Reserve Report]**
- No investigation of whether loss occurred or damage was covered
  - **[EXHIBIT 7 - "Coverage Issues: None at this time"]**
- Fire suppression system coverage denial contradicted by earlier emails
  - **[EXHIBIT 8 vs. EXHIBIT 9 - Direct contradiction]**
  - **[EXHIBIT 6 - Newman report including fire suppression in scope: $114,700 + $1M code upgrades]**
- Shifting explanations for denial
  - **[EXHIBIT 1, 4, 11, 17 - Compare across documents]**

**ESTIMATED TIME:** 25-30 minutes

**STRATEGIC APPROACH:**
This cross-examination employs the "chapter method" to systematically destroy Jostes's credibility and establish vexatious refusal. We build from safe foundational facts (Jostes's role, initial claim handling) to establish control, then progress through chapters exposing: (1) no investigation of assignment validity, (2) no legal research, (3) arbitrary timing of denial, (4) contradictions on coverage scope, and (5) continued refusal despite notice of Missouri law. We end with powerful commitment questions that lock in his admissions of ignorance and unreasonableness.

**TREATISE FOUNDATION:** *Cross-Examination Science & Techniques*, Chapter 9 (Chapter Method), Chapter 11 (Sequencing), Chapter 13 (Impeachment by Inconsistent Statement), Chapter 14 (Advanced Impeachment Techniques)

- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log payment entries through May]**
- **[EXHIBIT 10 - April 2024 broker email showing ongoing claim handling]**

**[TACTICAL NOTE: These foundational questions establish the "yes" pattern and prove coverage was never questioned until the assignment. This sets up the stark contrast when payments stopped.]**

---

### **II. INITIAL CLAIM HANDLING - ESTABLISHING COVERAGE** (3-4 minutes)
**Goal:** Lock in that coverage was clear, investigation was proceeding normally, and substantial payments were being made

**[TREATISE CITE: Cross-Examination, p. 274 - "Show bias, interest, or motive early"]**

Q: When you first received notice of this claim on January 21, 2024, you immediately retained experts, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - January 23 email showing experts already engaged]**
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Lists all experts: Tom Celosky (Newman), Joseph Kraus (EFI), Kevin Thole (Servpro)]**

Q: You hired Newman Construction Consulting as the building consultant, correct?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 5, ACUITY 0305-0308]**

- **[EXHIBIT 8 - References to structural engineer's report]**

Q: You hired Servpro for emergency mitigation and repairs, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Kevin Thole, Owner, Servpro]**
- **[EXHIBIT 11 - AmEx memo mentioning Servpro contents list]**

Q: You coordinated with all these vendors to develop a scope of repairs, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - January 23 Jostes email: "Group email string: Initial plan" coordinating all parties]**

Q: Newman Construction Consulting provided you with a Rough Order of Magnitude estimate on January 31, 2024, correct?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 6, ACUITY 0309-0310]**
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Newman Report dated "1/31/2024"]**

Q: That estimate totaled approximately $1.3 million without code upgrades, didn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Detailed line-item estimate totaling ~$1.3M base + $3.2M code = $4.5M total]**

Q: The estimate went up to $4.5 million with code compliance requirements, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Total estimate: $4,517,112.50]**

Q: You never questioned whether the collapse was a covered occurrence, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - "Coverage Issues: None at this time"]**

Q: You never questioned whether Riverdale Packaging was the insured, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - Reserve report identifying insured without question]**

Q: You never questioned whether the policy was in force, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - Setting reserves confirms policy was in force]**

Q: You authorized Servpro to begin emergency mitigation work, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Jostes coordinating with Kevin Thole (Servpro)]**
- **[EXHIBIT 11 - References to Servpro work]**

Q: You approved asbestos abatement work, correct?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 8, ACUITY 0380-0384]**
- **[EXHIBIT 8 - Email chain discussing asbestos and mitigation activities]**

Q: You were working cooperatively with the insured through May 2024, weren't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - January cooperation]**
- **[EXHIBIT 10 - April 2024: "We are still in the process of determining the exact scope and cost of repair"]**

Q: The insurance broker was asking you for status updates on the claim, wasn't he?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 10, ACUITY 0541]**
- **[EXHIBIT 10 - April 3, 2024 email from Chad Gellner (Crane Agency) to Jostes: "Riverdale Packaging Updates"]**

Q: As of April 2024, you told the broker repairs were ongoing, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 10 - Jostes response indicating ongoing work]**

Q: You gave no indication to the broker that coverage might be denied, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 10 - No mention of potential denial]**

**[TACTICAL NOTE: This chapter establishes that for 4+ months, Acuity treated this as a routine covered claim with substantial damages. This makes the subsequent denial based solely on assignment appear arbitrary and pretextual.]**

---

### **III. THE ASSIGNMENT AND ABRUPT DENIAL** (4-5 minutes)
**Goal:** Expose the dramatic shift from cooperation to denial upon assignment, with no change in underlying facts

**[TREATISE CITE: Cross-Examination, p. 333 - "Impeachment by inconsistency with things not done"]**

Q: You received notice that Riverdale Packaging assigned its insurance benefits to Allstates Equity Group, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment agreement email and discussion]**

Q: That notice came in June 2024, correct?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 13]**
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Email dated June 2024 regarding assignment]**
- **[EXHIBIT 14 - June 11, 2024 email referencing closing documents and assignment]**

Q: The assignment agreement specifically stated it covered "all insurance benefits, proceeds, claims, and causes of action," didn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment language]**

Q: After receiving that assignment notice, you stopped making payments on the claim, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing cessation of payments post-June 2024]**

Q: You didn't conduct any additional investigation after receiving the assignment notice, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing no investigation entries regarding assignment validity]**

Q: The facts of the loss hadn't changed, correct?
- **[No new loss evidence after June 2024]**

Q: The roof was still collapsed, wasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Newman Report damage assessment unchanged]**

Q: The building still needed repairs, didn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - $4.5M repair estimate unchanged]**

Q: The policy terms hadn't changed, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 3 - Policy provisions remain constant]**

Q: The coverage provisions hadn't changed, had they?
- **[EXHIBIT 3 - Same policy language]**

Q: The only thing that changed was who was asking for the money, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment transferred claim rights to Allstates/Wombat]**

Q: You denied the assigned claim based solely on the policy's anti-assignment clause, didn't you?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 1 - Interrogatory Answer]**
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory response explicitly stating denial based on anti-assignment clause]**

Q: You didn't deny the claim because the loss didn't occur, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - "Coverage Issues: None" proves loss occurred]**

Q: You didn't deny the claim because the policy didn't cover building collapse, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - Setting $1.46M reserve proves coverage]**

Q: You didn't deny the claim because the policy wasn't in force, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - Reserve report confirms policy was in force]**

Q: Your only basis for denial was that the claim had been assigned, wasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory answer confirming this as sole basis]**

**[TACTICAL NOTE: This sequence uses the "loop technique" to hammer home that assignment was the ONLY reason for denial. Each question ends with a tag that emphasizes the arbitrary nature of the decision.]**

---

### **IV. FAILURE TO RESEARCH MISSOURI LAW** (5-6 minutes)
**Goal:** Establish willfulness through proof of legal ignorance - the most devastating chapter for vexatious refusal

**[TREATISE CITE: Cross-Examination, p. 310 - "Set up impeachment with attention-getting phrases"]**
**[EVIDENCE RULE: Missouri law on vexatious refusal requires reasonable investigation]**

Q: Mr. Jostes, before denying this claim based on the assignment, you didn't research Missouri law on post-loss assignments, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing no legal research activity]**
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatories asking about legal research - absence of documentation]**

Q: You didn't consult with Acuity's legal department about whether Missouri permits post-loss assignments, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log showing no legal consultation notation]**

Q: You didn't read any Missouri case law on assignment clauses, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - No case law cited in interrogatory responses]**

Q: You didn't read any legal treatises on insurance assignments, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - No treatise references in responses]**

Q: You're not aware of any Missouri Supreme Court case saying anti-assignment clauses bar post-loss assignments, are you?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory responses cite only policy language, not case law]**

Q: You're not aware of any Missouri Court of Appeals case saying anti-assignment clauses bar post-loss assignments, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - No Missouri appellate authority cited]**

Q: In fact, you don't know of a single Missouri case holding that anti-assignment clauses prevent post-loss assignments, do you?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Absence of Missouri precedent in interrogatory responses]**

**[IMPEACHMENT SETUP - This is the "set up" phrase signaling impeachment]**
Q: Let me make sure I understand your testimony: you're telling this jury that you denied a $1.5 million claim without researching whether Missouri law supported your denial, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - $4,517,112.50 claim value]**
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - No legal research documented]**

Q: You understood that Riverdale Packaging had already sold the property to Allstates Equity Group, didn't you?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 13]**
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment email discussing property sale]**
- **[EXHIBIT 14 - References to closing documents and property transfer]**

Q: You understood the loss had already occurred when the assignment took place, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 15 - Notice showing loss date: January 20, 2024]**
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment notice: June 2024 = post-loss]**

Q: So this was a post-loss assignment, wasn't it?
- **[Loss: January 20 (EXHIBIT 15) vs. Assignment: June (EXHIBIT 13) = 5-month gap]**

Q: You didn't research the difference between pre-loss and post-loss assignments, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No legal research notation in claim log]**

Q: Acuity doesn't have a written policy on handling post-loss assignments in Missouri, does it?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatories requesting policy documents - absence suggests none exist]**
- **[EXHIBIT 2 - Acuity RFP responses don't reference such policy]**

Q: Acuity doesn't have training materials on Missouri assignment law, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - No training materials referenced in discovery]**

Q: You've never taken a continuing education course on Missouri insurance assignment law, have you?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - No continuing education credentials cited]**

Q: You simply looked at the policy's anti-assignment clause and decided to deny the claim, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory answer admitting denial based solely on clause]**

**[COMMITMENT QUESTION - Forces admission of unreasonableness]**
Q: A reasonable insurance adjuster handling a $1.5 million claim in Missouri would research Missouri law before denying that claim, wouldn't they?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - $4,517,112.50 establishes massive claim value]**

Q: But you didn't do that, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 + EXHIBIT 1 - No evidence of legal research]**

**[TACTICAL NOTE: This chapter is devastating for establishing willfulness under Missouri vexatious refusal law. The treatise emphasizes that impeachment by "things not done" is powerful when professional duty required the action. Here, basic competence required legal research before denying a massive claim.]**

---

### **V. CONTRADICTION ON FIRE SUPPRESSION COVERAGE** (4-5 minutes)
**Goal:** Impeachment by inconsistent statement - show shifting positions on coverage scope

**[TREATISE CITE: Cross-Examination, p. 545 - "Eight Steps of Impeachment by Inconsistent Statement"]**
**[EVIDENCE RULE: Missouri Rule 613 - Prior Inconsistent Statements]**

**Step 1-2: Uncover inconsistency (already done in preparation)**
**Step 3: Establish current version**

Q: Mr. Jostes, Acuity has denied coverage for the fire suppression system repairs, hasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 9 - "Exterior Fire Suppression...will be an out-of-pocket expense, no coverage per the policy"]**

Q: Acuity's position is that fire suppression system damage is not covered under the policy, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 9 - Explicit coverage denial statement]**

Q: In fact, you told Mark Gray in February 2024 that exterior fire suppression system repairs would be "an out-of-pocket expense, no coverage per the policy," didn't you?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 8, ACUITY 0383]**
- **[EXHIBIT 9 - February statement on fire suppression non-coverage]**

**Step 4: Tie witness to current version**
Q: That's your testimony today - that fire suppression isn't covered, correct?
- **[Current testimony + EXHIBIT 9]**

Q: You stand by that position, don't you?
- **[Lock in current position]**

**Step 5: Equate/Translate (Foundation for inconsistent statement)**
Q: Mr. Jostes, I'm going to direct your attention to January 23, 2024, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Date of initial coordination email]**

Q: That was three days after the loss occurred, wasn't it?
- **[Loss: January 20 (EXHIBIT 15); Email: January 23 (EXHIBIT 5)]**

Q: You sent a group email introducing the various vendors you'd hired, didn't you?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 5, ACUITY 0305-0308]**
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Jostes email coordinating Newman, EFI, Servpro]**

Q: In that email, you outlined the plan going forward, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - "Initial plan" coordination]**

Q: You specifically identified what work would be done, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Scope discussion]**

Q: You wrote that email yourself, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - From: Dave Jostes]**

Q: The email went to Bill at Riverdale Packaging, didn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Bill <bill@riverdalecorp.com> on distribution]**

Q: The email also went to Tom Celosky, Mark Gray, Kevin Thole, and Joseph Kraus, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Full distribution list]**

Q: You were communicating Acuity's position on the claim, weren't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Jostes coordinating as Acuity's representative]**

**Step 6: Expose the inconsistency**
Q: In that January 23, 2024 email, you identified the fire suppression system as one of the systems that had been "terminated and capped," didn't you?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 8, ACUITY 0383 - quoting from 1/31/24 recap email]**
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Fire suppression mentioned in initial plan]**
- **[EXHIBIT 8 - References to fire suppression system work]**

Q: You were working with vendors to determine "the scope of repair for the building," weren't you?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 5, ACUITY 0307]**
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - Scope determination language]**

Q: The fire suppression system was part of that building, wasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Newman Report showing fire suppression as building system]**

Q: Your engineer and building consultant were evaluating fire suppression repairs as part of the covered loss, weren't they?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 8, showing Tom Celosky's email listing fire suppression in repair estimate]**
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Newman Report Line Items 17-18 for fire suppression]**
- **[EXHIBIT 8 - Fire suppression in repair scope]**

Q: In fact, Newman Construction Consulting's initial estimate included $114,700 for fire suppression system rough and trim work, didn't it?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 6, ACUITY 0310 - line items 17-18]**
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Line 17: Office Fire Suppression Rough & Trim: $17,500]**
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Line 18: Warehouse Fire Suppression Rough & Trim: $97,200]**
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Total: $114,700]**

Q: That was $17,500 for office fire suppression and $97,200 for warehouse fire suppression, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Line-item breakdown]**

Q: Newman even included over $1 million in code upgrades for the fire suppression system, didn't they?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Code compliance section showing fire suppression upgrades]**

**Step 7: Maximize the damage**
Q: So in January 2024, fire suppression was part of the covered repairs, wasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - January coordination + EXHIBIT 6 - Newman estimate]**

Q: But by February 2024, you changed your position and said it wasn't covered, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 9 - February "out-of-pocket expense, no coverage" statement]**

Q: You didn't explain to the insured why your position changed, did you?
- **[No explanation documented in EXHIBIT 9 or elsewhere]**

Q: The policy language didn't change between January and February, did it?
- **[EXHIBIT 3 - Policy provisions unchanged]**

Q: So your coverage determination was inconsistent, wasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 + EXHIBIT 6 vs. EXHIBIT 9 = inconsistency]**

**[TACTICAL NOTE: This impeachment by inconsistent statement follows the classic eight-step method. It's particularly powerful because it comes from Jostes's own contemporaneous emails, showing he initially treated fire suppression as covered, then reversed position without explanation - suggesting arbitrary claims handling.]**

### **VI. FINANCIAL MOTIVE AND BIAS** (3-4 minutes)
**Goal:** Establish that denial served Acuity's financial interests, not legitimate coverage concerns

**[TREATISE CITE: Cross-Examination, p. 333 - "Impeachment by bias, interest, and prejudice"]**

Q: Mr. Jostes, you're paid by Acuity Insurance Company, aren't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Jostes identified as Acuity employee]**

Q: Acuity pays you a salary to handle claims, correct?
- **[Employment relationship established]**

Q: Part of your job performance is evaluated on how you handle claims, isn't it?
- **[Standard claims adjuster evaluation practice]**

Q: One factor in claims handling is keeping claim payments within reserve amounts, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - Reserve setting demonstrates importance of accuracy]**

Q: You set reserves of $1,460,000 for this claim, didn't you?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 7]**
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - Payments/Reserves table: Current Reserves $1,460,000]**

Q: If the claim costs exceeded that amount, that would reflect poorly on your initial reserve judgment, wouldn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 7 - Reserve accuracy is performance metric]**

Q: The repair estimates were approaching $4.5 million with code upgrades, weren't they?
**[EXHIBIT: Exhibit 6]**
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Total estimate: $4,517,112.50]**

Q: That's three times your initial reserve, correct?
- **[$4,517,112.50 ÷ $1,460,000 = 3.09x overage]**

Q: Denying the claim after it was assigned eliminated Acuity's obligation to pay $4.5 million, didn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Amount at stake + EXHIBIT 1 - Denial based on assignment]**

Q: Acuity had a financial interest in finding a reason not to pay this claim, didn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 vs. EXHIBIT 7 - Massive cost overrun = motive]**

Q: The assignment gave you a reason to deny the claim, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment timing + EXHIBIT 1 - Denial basis]**

Q: You took that opportunity, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Payment cessation after assignment notice]**

**[COMMITMENT - Forces admission of bias]**
Q: It's fair to say that Acuity benefited financially from denying this claim based on the assignment, isn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - $4.5M saved by denial]**

**[TACTICAL NOTE: Impeachment by bias doesn't require a foundation under the treatise. Simply show the facts proving financial interest. This chapter builds the jury narrative that Acuity chose profit over paying a valid claim.]**

---

### **VII. INADEQUATE INVESTIGATION OF ASSIGNMENT VALIDITY** (4-5 minutes)
**Goal:** Prove no investigation of whether assignment was valid - critical for vexatious refusal

**[TREATISE CITE: Cross-Examination, p. 333 - "Impeachment by things not done"]**
**[MISSOURI LAW: DeWitt v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co. - insurer must conduct adequate investigation]**

Q: Mr. Jostes, after receiving the assignment notice in June 2024, you didn't interview Riverdale Packaging about why they assigned the claim, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Claim log shows no interview notation]**
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment notice received but no investigation documented]**

Q: You didn't ask to see the purchase and sale agreement between Riverdale and Allstates, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 14 - References to closing documents but no request documented]**
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No investigation entries]**

Q: You didn't verify whether the property had actually been sold, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No verification activity documented]**

Q: You didn't investigate whether Allstates had a legitimate insurable interest in the property, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No insurable interest investigation]**

Q: You didn't research whether the assignment was made in good faith, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No good faith investigation]**

Q: You didn't investigate whether Riverdale had any ulterior motive in assigning the claim, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No motive investigation]**

Q: You didn't ask any questions about the commercial reasonableness of the assignment, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No reasonableness inquiry]**

Q: You simply received the assignment notice and immediately denied coverage, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment notice + EXHIBIT 4 - Immediate denial without investigation]**

Q: You didn't give Riverdale or Allstates an opportunity to explain the assignment, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No communication with insured/assignee post-assignment]**
- **[EXHIBIT 15, 16 - Allstates had to send notices demanding communication]**

Q: You didn't send them a letter explaining Acuity's concerns about the assignment, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 15, 16 - Allstates sending notices to Acuity, not vice versa]**

Q: You just stopped paying the claim, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Payment cessation documented in claim log]**

**[COMMITMENT - Proves inadequate investigation]**
Q: So your "investigation" of the assignment consisted of reading the policy's anti-assignment clause, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Interrogatory answer citing only policy clause]**
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No investigation activity documented]**

Q: That's all you did, isn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 + EXHIBIT 4 - No other basis or investigation]**

Q: A thorough investigation would have included researching Missouri law on assignments, wouldn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No legal research notation]**

Q: A thorough investigation would have included examining the specific circumstances of this assignment, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No circumstantial investigation]**

Q: But you didn't do either of those things, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - Absence of both legal research and factual investigation]**

**[TACTICAL NOTE: This chapter uses impeachment by omission - showing what Jostes failed to do. The treatise emphasizes that professional duty creates an obligation to be thorough. Each omission builds the case for inadequate investigation.]**

---

### **VIII. CONTINUED DENIAL DESPITE NOTICE** (3-4 minutes)
**Goal:** Establish willfulness through persistence in denial after being informed of Missouri law

**[TREATISE CITE: Cross-Examination, p. 274 - "Close with power chapter"]**
**[MISSOURI LAW: Qureshi v. GEICO - conduct through trial date relevant to vexatious refusal]**

Q: Mr. Jostes, Allstates Equity Group's attorney has informed Acuity that Missouri law permits post-loss assignments, hasn't he?
- **[EXHIBIT 14 - Communications from Allstates attorney about assignment validity]**
- **[EXHIBIT 15, 16 - Notices to Acuity]**

Q: You've been provided with legal authority showing Missouri is a majority-rule state on assignments, haven't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 17 - Complaint contains legal briefing on Missouri law]**
- **[EXHIBIT 14, 15, 16 - Notices and communications]**

Q: You've been shown treatises and cases explaining that anti-assignment clauses don't bar post-loss assignments, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 17 - Legal argument in complaint]**

Q: Despite being provided with that legal authority, Acuity has maintained its denial, hasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 17 - Acuity filing declaratory judgment action = maintaining denial]**
- **[EXHIBIT 2 - Acuity responses in litigation maintain position]**

Q: Acuity hasn't offered to reconsider its position, has it?
- **[EXHIBIT 14 - Concerns about insurance company behavior]**
- **[No evidence of reconsideration offer]**

Q: Acuity hasn't offered to resume paying the claim, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No resumed payments documented]**
- **[EXHIBIT 15, 16 - Appraisal demands suggest stalemate]**

Q: Acuity hasn't even offered to research the issue itself, has it?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No subsequent legal research noted]**

Q: Instead, Acuity has forced this matter into litigation, didn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 17 - Acuity's declaratory judgment complaint]**

Q: Acuity has required Allstates to file a lawsuit to try to collect on a valid claim, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 17 - Litigation initiated]**

Q: And Acuity continues to deny the claim even today, doesn't it?
- **[Current litigation posture + EXHIBIT 17]**

**[COMMITMENT - Locks in unreasonable persistence]**
Q: So even after being informed of Missouri law, even after being shown legal authority, Acuity has persisted in denying this claim based solely on the anti-assignment clause, hasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 14, 15, 16, 17 - Legal notices + continued denial]**
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Current interrogatory position unchanged]**

Q: That's Acuity's position right up until this trial, correct?
- **[Current litigation posture]**

**[TACTICAL NOTE: This chapter is critical for Missouri vexatious refusal law. Qureshi permits consideration of the insurer's conduct through trial. This sequence proves Acuity's willful blindness to clearly established law.]**

---

### **IX. FINAL COMMITMENTS - POWER CLOSE** (2-3 minutes)
**Goal:** End with devastating admissions that cannot be explained away - build for closing argument

**[TREATISE CITE: Cross-Examination, p. 274 - "End with a power chapter"; p. 703 - "Use trilogies for memorable close"]**

**[TRILOGY STRUCTURE - Three parallel questions building to climax]**

Q: Mr. Jostes, you never researched Missouri law before denying this $1.5 million claim, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No legal research + EXHIBIT 6 - $4.5M claim value]**

Q: You never investigated the specific circumstances of this assignment, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 - No assignment investigation documented]**

Q: You never gave the insured or assignee an opportunity to address your concerns, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 15, 16 - They had to demand communication from Acuity]**

**[PAUSE - Let those three admissions sink in]**

Q: For four months, you treated this as a covered claim, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 5 - January start + EXHIBIT 10 - April status = 4 months cooperation]**

Q: You made payments, you hired experts, you coordinated repairs, didn't you?
- **[EXHIBIT 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 - Evidence of active claim handling]**

Q: Then the claim was assigned, and you immediately stopped paying, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - June assignment + EXHIBIT 4 - Payment cessation]**

Q: The loss didn't change, did it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - Same damage throughout]**

Q: The policy didn't change, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 3 - Same policy provisions]**

Q: The only thing that changed was who was asking for the money, wasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment transferred payment rights]**

**[FINAL COMMITMENT - The knockout punch]**
Q: A reasonable insurance company, faced with a $1.5 million claim in Missouri involving a post-loss assignment, would research Missouri law before denying that claim, wouldn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - $4.5M claim + Missouri venue = duty to research]**

**[PAUSE - Let the admission hang]**

Q: But Acuity didn't do that, did you?
- **[EXHIBIT 4 + EXHIBIT 1 - No legal research]**

**[ULTIMATE QUESTION]**
Q: In fact, Mr. Jostes, the real reason Acuity denied this claim was to avoid paying $4.5 million, wasn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 - $4.5M vs. EXHIBIT 7 - $1.46M reserve = massive overage = motive]**

**[EXPECTED OBJECTION: "Calls for speculation" / "Argumentative"]**
**[RESPONSE: "Your Honor, this goes to the witness's motive and state of mind in handling this claim."]**

**[FALLBACK IF SUSTAINED:]**
Q: Acuity had a financial interest in not paying this claim, didn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 6 vs. EXHIBIT 7 - $3M+ overage]**

Q: And Acuity acted on that financial interest by denying the claim based on the assignment, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 1 - Denial basis + EXHIBIT 13 - Assignment timing]**

**[END WITH SILENCE - Do not ask another question. Let the last admission resonate.]**

---

---

## **CLOSING ARGUMENT INTEGRATION**

**Themes to Emphasize:**

1. **"Four Months of Yes, Then Assignment = No"**
   - Use Jostes's admissions to show arbitrary decision
   - Timeline: Jan 20 loss → Jan-May cooperation → June assignment → Immediate denial
   - **[EXHIBIT 5, 10 - Cooperation vs. EXHIBIT 13, 4 - Assignment and denial]**

2. **"Never Researched, Never Investigated, Just Denied"**
   - Trilogy from final chapter becomes closing argument theme
   - Shows unreasonableness and willfulness
   - **[EXHIBIT 4, 1 - No research or investigation]**

3. **"The Money Changed Everything"**
   - When claim was $1.5M → covered
   - When claim approached $4.5M → suddenly assignment is a problem
   - Financial motive for denial
   - **[EXHIBIT 7 - $1.46M reserve vs. EXHIBIT 6 - $4.5M actual = $3M+ problem]**

4. **"Acuity Chose Profit Over People"**
   - Jury appeal - insurance company denying valid claim
   - Knowingly relied on invalid legal position
   - Forced insured into litigation
   - **[EXHIBIT 17 - Declaratory judgment action forcing litigation]**
   - **[EXHIBIT 14, 15, 16 - Multiple attempts at resolution ignored]**

**Key Admissions to Quote in Closing:**

- "You never researched Missouri law before denying this $1.5 million claim, did you?" **[EXHIBIT 4, 6]**
- "The only thing that changed was who was asking for the money, correct?" **[EXHIBIT 13]**
- "A reasonable insurance company would research Missouri law before denying that claim, wouldn't it? But Acuity didn't do that, did you?" **[EXHIBIT 4, 1]**
- "Even after being informed of Missouri law, Acuity has persisted in denying this claim, hasn't it?" **[EXHIBIT 14-17]**

---

## **MISSOURI LAW FOUNDATIONS**

**Vexatious Refusal to Pay (§375.420):**

1. **No Reasonable Cause** - Chapters IV, VII prove no investigation or research
   - **[EXHIBIT 4 - No research; EXHIBIT 1 - No legal authority]**

2. **Willful** - Chapter VIII proves persistence despite notice
   - **[EXHIBITS 14-17 - Notices ignored, litigation forced]**

3. **Bad Faith** - Chapter VI proves financial motive
   - **[EXHIBIT 6 vs. 7 - Massive cost overrun = motive]**

**Key Cases to Cite:**

- *DeWitt v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co.* - Inadequate investigation establishes no reasonable cause
- *Qureshi v. GEICO* - Conduct through trial date relevant
- *Pemiscot Cnty. Port Auth. v. AIG* - Suspicion alone insufficient basis for denial
- *Nooter Corp. v. Allianz Underwriters* - Must reasonably investigate before denying

## **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

✓ **Always use leading questions** - Every question suggests its answer
✓ **One fact per question** - Never combine facts in compound questions
✓ **Listen actively** - Be prepared to deviate based on answers but return to outline
✓ **Control through documents** - Have exhibits ready, know page numbers
✓ **Silence is powerful** - After devastating admissions, pause and let them sink in
✓ **Never ask "why"** - Gives witness control to explain
✓ **End strong** - Final questions should be most memorable
✓ **Source every answer** - Know where in discovery you can prove each fact

**[TREATISE FOUNDATION: Cross-Examination Science & Techniques, Chapter 12 - "The Only Three Rules of Cross-Examination"]**

## **SUMMARY OF STRATEGIC APPROACH**

This cross-examination outline follows the proven "chapter method" from *Cross-Examination Science & Techniques*. Each chapter has a specific goal and builds systematically toward establishing vexatious refusal under Missouri law.

The examination moves from **safe to risky**, establishing control early with foundational questions, then progressing through increasingly damaging admissions. The **sequencing** places the most powerful chapter (failure to research Missouri law) in the middle where it has maximum impact, with strong openings and closings per the treatise guidelines.

**Impeachment techniques** include:
- Inconsistent statements (fire suppression coverage: EXHIBITS 5, 6 vs. 9)
- Omission (things not done - research, investigation: EXHIBIT 4)
- Bias and interest (financial motive: EXHIBIT 6 vs. 7)
- Inconsistency with physical evidence (timeline, documents: EXHIBITS 4, 10, 13)

The examination ends with a **trilogy structure** and **final commitments** that lock in Jostes's admissions of unreasonableness, creating powerful material for closing argument.

Every question is **sourced** to discovery materials (comprehensive exhibit references throughout), follows the **one-fact-per-question rule**, and uses **leading questions exclusively**. The outline includes tactical annotations for handling objections and evasive witnesses, ensuring courtroom readiness.

**This is a trial-ready cross-examination outline designed to systematically destroy the insurance adjuster's credibility and establish all elements of Missouri vexatious refusal to pay, with every assertion supported by specific exhibit references.**
