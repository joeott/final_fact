Q: That notice came in June 2024, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 13** - June date
- **EXHIBIT 14** - June 11, 2024 attorney email

Q: The assignment agreement specifically stated it covered "all insurance benefits, proceeds, claims, and causes of action," didn't it?

- **EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer provision (policy language unchanged)

Q: The coverage provisions hadn't changed, had they?
- **EXHIBIT 27** - Property Damage definition (same)

Q: The only thing that changed was who was asking for the money, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Assignment

Q: You denied the assigned claim based solely on the policy's anti-assignment clause, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 1** - Interrogatory answer
- **EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer provision (your sole basis)

Q: You didn't deny the claim because the loss didn't occur, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 7** - "Coverage Issues: None"

Q: You didn't deny the claim because the policy didn't cover building collapse, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 7** - $1.46M reserve
- **[POLICY LANGUAGE: Coverage applies to collapse - Exhibits 20-24 needed for complete policy]**

Q: You didn't deny the claim because the policy wasn't in force, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 7**

Q: Your only basis for denial was that the claim had been assigned, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 1**
- **EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer/Assignment provision

---

## IV. FAILURE TO RESEARCH MISSOURI LAW (5-6 min)

Q: Mr. Jostes, before denying this claim based on the assignment, you didn't research Missouri law on post-loss assignments, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4** - No legal research notation
- **EXHIBIT 1** - No research documented

Q: You didn't consult with Acuity's legal department about whether Missouri permits post-loss assignments, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You didn't read any Missouri case law on assignment clauses, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 1** - No case law cited

Q: You didn't read any legal treatises on insurance assignments, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 1**

Q: You're not aware of any Missouri Supreme Court case saying anti-assignment clauses bar post-loss assignments, are you?
- **EXHIBIT 1**

Q: You're not aware of any Missouri Court of Appeals case saying anti-assignment clauses bar post-loss assignments, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 1**

Q: In fact, you don't know of a single Missouri case holding that anti-assignment clauses prevent post-loss assignments, do you?
- **EXHIBIT 1**

Q: Let me make sure I understand your testimony: you're telling this jury that you denied a $1.5 million claim without researching whether Missouri law supported your denial, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - $4.5M claim value
- **EXHIBIT 1** - No research

Q: You understood that Riverdale Packaging had already sold the property to Allstates Equity Group, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Property sale discussion
- **EXHIBIT 14** - Closing documents

Q: You understood the loss had already occurred when the assignment took place, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 15** - Loss: January 20, 2024
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Assignment: June 2024

Q: So this was a post-loss assignment, wasn't it?
- **Loss: January 20 (EXHIBIT 15) vs. Assignment: June (EXHIBIT 13)**

Q: You didn't research the difference between pre-loss and post-loss assignments, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: Acuity doesn't have a written policy on handling post-loss assignments in Missouri, does it?
- **EXHIBIT 1** - No policy produced
- **EXHIBIT 2**

Q: Acuity doesn't have training materials on Missouri assignment law, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 1**

Q: You've never taken a continuing education course on Missouri insurance assignment law, have you?
- **EXHIBIT 1**

Q: You simply looked at the policy's anti-assignment clause and decided to deny the claim, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 1** - Sole basis
- **EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer provision (the clause you relied on)

Q: A reasonable insurance adjuster handling a $1.5 million claim in Missouri would research Missouri law before denying that claim, wouldn't they?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - $4.5M value

Q: But you didn't do that, did you?
- **EXHIBITS 1, 4**

---

## V. FIRE SUPPRESSION CONTRADICTION (4-5 min)

**Establish Current Version:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, Acuity has denied coverage for the fire suppression system repairs, hasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 9** - "Out-of-pocket expense, no coverage"

Q: Acuity's position is that fire suppression system damage is not covered under the policy, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 9**

Q: In fact, you told Mark Gray in February 2024 that exterior fire suppression system repairs would be "an out-of-pocket expense, no coverage per the policy," didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 9**

**Tie to Current Version:**

Q: That's your testimony today - that fire suppression isn't covered, correct?

Q: You stand by that position, don't you?

**Foundation for Prior Statement:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, I'm going to direct your attention to January 23, 2024, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 5** - Date

Q: That was three days after the loss occurred, wasn't it?
- **Loss: January 20 (EXHIBIT 15); Email: January 23 (EXHIBIT 5)**

Q: You sent a group email introducing the various vendors you'd hired, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 5**

Q: In that email, you outlined the plan going forward, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 5**

Q: You wrote that email yourself, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 5** - From: Dave Jostes

Q: The email went to Bill at Riverdale Packaging, didn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 5**

Q: The email also went to Tom Celosky, Mark Gray, Kevin Thole, and Joseph Kraus, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 5**

Q: You were communicating Acuity's position on the claim, weren't you?
- **EXHIBIT 5**

**Expose the Inconsistency:**

Q: In that January 23, 2024 email, you identified the fire suppression system as one of the systems that had been "terminated and capped," didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 5**
- **EXHIBIT 8**

Q: You were working with vendors to determine "the scope of repair for the building," weren't you?
- **EXHIBIT 5**

Q: The fire suppression system was part of that building, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Newman Report

Q: Your engineer and building consultant were evaluating fire suppression repairs as part of the covered loss, weren't they?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Line items 17-18
- **EXHIBIT 8**

Q: In fact, Newman Construction Consulting's initial estimate included $114,700 for fire suppression system rough and trim work, didn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Line 17: Office $17,500 + Line 18: Warehouse $97,200

Q: That was $17,500 for office fire suppression and $97,200 for warehouse fire suppression, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 6**

Q: Newman even included over $1 million in code upgrades for the fire suppression system, didn't they?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Code compliance section
- **[POLICY: Exhibit 22 - Requirement for Sprinklers; Exhibit 24 - Pay for Sprinkler Systems]**

**Maximize Damage:**

Q: So in January 2024, fire suppression was part of the covered repairs, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBITS 5, 6**

Q: But by February 2024, you changed your position and said it wasn't covered, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 9**

Q: You didn't explain to the insured why your position changed, did you?

Q: The policy language didn't change between January and February, did it?
- **EXHIBIT 22** - Sprinkler requirement (unchanged)
- **EXHIBIT 24** - Sprinkler payment provision (unchanged)

Q: So your coverage determination was inconsistent, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBITS 5, 6 vs. EXHIBIT 9**

---

## VI. POLICY LANGUAGE CONTRADICTIONS

**A. Property Damage Definition Creates Coverage:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy defines "property damage" as "physical injury to tangible property," doesn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 27** - Property Damage definition

Q: That definition includes "all resulting loss of use of that property," correct?
- **EXHIBIT 27** - "including all resulting loss of use"

Q: The collapsed roof was physical injury to tangible property, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Newman Report showing physical damage
- **EXHIBIT 27** - Definition satisfied

Q: The fire suppression system was damaged as a result of the roof collapse, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Claim log: "roof collapsed causing damage to sprinkler system"
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Fire suppression in repair scope

Q: So damage to the fire suppression system was "resulting loss" from the physical injury to the roof, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 27** - "all resulting loss of use"
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Causation established

Q: Under the policy's own definition, that's covered property damage, isn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 27** - Definition
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Damage fits definition

**B. Sprinkler Requirement Creates Coverage:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy requires the insured to maintain an operational sprinkler system, doesn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 22 - Requirement for Sprinklers]**

Q: In fact, the policy states that failure to maintain the sprinkler system could void coverage, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 22]**

Q: So the policy treats the sprinkler system as essential to coverage, doesn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 22]**

Q: Yet when the sprinkler system was damaged by the covered collapse, you denied coverage for its repair, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 9** - Denial
- **[EXHIBIT 24 - Pay for Sprinkler Systems provision]**

Q: That's contradictory, isn't it - requiring sprinklers but refusing to pay to fix them when damaged by a covered loss?
- **[EXHIBIT 22 vs. EXHIBIT 9]**

Q: The policy specifically provides coverage for sprinkler system damage, doesn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 24 - Pay for Sprinkler Systems]**

Q: So denying fire suppression coverage contradicts the policy's own sprinkler payment provision, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 24 vs. EXHIBIT 9]**

**C. Property of Others Coverage Creates Payment Obligation:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy provides coverage for damage to "property of others," doesn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 23 - Coverage for Damage to Property of Others]**

Q: After the assignment, Allstates Equity Group owned the property, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Property sale/assignment
- **EXHIBIT 14** - Closing documents

Q: So the damaged property was now "property of others" from Riverdale's perspective, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 13**
- **[EXHIBIT 23]**

Q: The policy covers damage to property of others in the insured's care, custody, or control, doesn't it?
- **[EXHIBIT 23]**

Q: The damaged warehouse was in Riverdale's care, custody, and control when the loss occurred, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Loss description
- **EXHIBIT 15** - Notice

Q: So under the "property of others" provision, there's coverage, correct?
- **[EXHIBIT 23 - Coverage provision]**

**D. Appraisal Provision Requires Paying First, Disputing Later:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, when you and the insured disagree on the amount of loss, the policy provides for appraisal, doesn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - Appraisal provision
- **EXHIBIT 26B** - Appraisal (duplicate/variant)

Q: The appraisal provision states: "If we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal," correct?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - Exact language

Q: That provision is for resolving VALUE disputes, isn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - "value" and "amount"

Q: It's not for resolving coverage disputes, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - No mention of coverage disputes in appraisal provision

Q: The appraisal provision explicitly states: "If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim," doesn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - "retain our right to deny"

Q: That language contemplates paying the appraisal amount FIRST, then denying coverage if you have grounds, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - Sequential structure: appraise value → pay → retain right to deny

Q: Yet you denied coverage BEFORE any appraisal was conducted, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Denial timing
- **EXHIBIT 16** - Appraisal demand came AFTER denial

Q: You reversed the order the policy contemplates, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - Policy order: pay → deny
- **Actual order: deny → appraisal demands (EXHIBITS 14, 15, 16)**

**E. Legal Action Timing Requirement:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy has a Legal Action Against Us provision, doesn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - "Legal Action Against Us"

Q: That provision states: "No one may bring a legal action against us unless there has been full compliance with all of the terms of this Coverage Part," correct?
- **EXHIBIT 26**

Q: And it requires the action to be brought "within 10 years after the date on which the direct physical loss or damage occurred," doesn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - 10-year limitation

Q: The loss occurred January 20, 2024, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 15**

Q: So any legal action would need to be brought by January 20, 2034, wouldn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 26** - 10-year period

Q: Yet you forced this claim into litigation in 2024 - immediately after the assignment - didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 17** - Complaint filed 2024

Q: The policy contemplated a 10-year window for resolving claims, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 26**

Q: But you didn't give the claim even 6 months before denying it based on the assignment, did you?
- **Loss: Jan 20 (EXHIBIT 15); Assignment: June (EXHIBIT 13); Denial: June (EXHIBIT 4)**

---

## VII. FINANCIAL MOTIVE AND BIAS (3-4 min)

Q: Mr. Jostes, you're paid by Acuity Insurance Company, aren't you?
- **EXHIBIT 1**

Q: Acuity pays you a salary to handle claims, correct?

Q: Part of your job performance is evaluated on how you handle claims, isn't it?

Q: One factor in claims handling is keeping claim payments within reserve amounts, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 7** - Reserve setting

Q: You set reserves of $1,460,000 for this claim, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 7**

Q: If the claim costs exceeded that amount, that would reflect poorly on your initial reserve judgment, wouldn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 7**

Q: The repair estimates were approaching $4.5 million with code upgrades, weren't they?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - $4,517,112.50

Q: That's three times your initial reserve, correct?
- **[$4.5M ÷ $1.46M = 3x]**

Q: Denying the claim after it was assigned eliminated Acuity's obligation to pay $4.5 million, didn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Amount at stake
- **EXHIBIT 1** - Denial

Q: Acuity had a financial interest in finding a reason not to pay this claim, didn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6 vs. 7** - Cost overrun

Q: The assignment gave you a reason to deny the claim, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Assignment
- **EXHIBIT 1** - Denial basis

Q: You took that opportunity, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Payment cessation

Q: It's fair to say that Acuity benefited financially from denying this claim based on the assignment, isn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - $4.5M saved

---

## VIII. INADEQUATE INVESTIGATION OF ASSIGNMENT (4-5 min)

Q: Mr. Jostes, after receiving the assignment notice in June 2024, you didn't interview Riverdale Packaging about why they assigned the claim, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4** - No interview
- **EXHIBIT 13**

Q: You didn't ask to see the purchase and sale agreement between Riverdale and Allstates, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 14** - Closing docs referenced but not requested
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You didn't verify whether the property had actually been sold, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You didn't investigate whether Allstates had a legitimate insurable interest in the property, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4**
- **[EXHIBIT 23 - Property of Others provision - insurable interest matters]**

Q: You didn't research whether the assignment was made in good faith, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You didn't investigate whether Riverdale had any ulterior motive in assigning the claim, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You didn't ask any questions about the commercial reasonableness of the assignment, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You simply received the assignment notice and immediately denied coverage, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Notice
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Immediate denial

Q: You didn't give Riverdale or Allstates an opportunity to explain the assignment, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4**
- **EXHIBITS 15, 16** - They had to demand communication

Q: You didn't send them a letter explaining Acuity's concerns about the assignment, correct?
- **EXHIBITS 15, 16** - Allstates sending notices, not Acuity

Q: You just stopped paying the claim, didn't you?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: So your "investigation" of the assignment consisted of reading the policy's anti-assignment clause, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 1**
- **EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer provision
- **EXHIBIT 4** - No other investigation

Q: That's all you did, isn't it?
- **EXHIBITS 1, 4**

Q: A thorough investigation would have included researching Missouri law on assignments, wouldn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: A thorough investigation would have included examining the specific circumstances of this assignment, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: But you didn't do either of those things, did you?
- **EXHIBITS 1, 4**

---

## IX. CONTINUED DENIAL DESPITE NOTICE (3-4 min)

Q: Mr. Jostes, Allstates Equity Group's attorney has informed Acuity that Missouri law permits post-loss assignments, hasn't he?
- **EXHIBIT 14** - Attorney communications
- **EXHIBITS 15, 16** - Notices

Q: You've been provided with legal authority showing Missouri is a majority-rule state on assignments, haven't you?
- **EXHIBIT 17** - Complaint (legal briefing)
- **EXHIBITS 14, 15, 16**

Q: You've been shown treatises and cases explaining that anti-assignment clauses don't bar post-loss assignments, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 17**

Q: Despite being provided with that legal authority, Acuity has maintained its denial, hasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 17** - Declaratory judgment action
- **EXHIBIT 2** - Litigation responses

Q: Acuity hasn't offered to reconsider its position, has it?
- **EXHIBIT 14**

Q: Acuity hasn't offered to resume paying the claim, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 4** - No resumed payments
- **EXHIBITS 15, 16** - Appraisal demands

Q: Acuity hasn't even offered to research the issue itself, has it?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: Instead, Acuity has forced this matter into litigation, didn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 17** - Lawsuit

Q: Acuity has required Allstates to file a lawsuit to try to collect on a valid claim, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 17**

Q: And Acuity continues to deny the claim even today, doesn't it?

Q: So even after being informed of Missouri law, even after being shown legal authority, Acuity has persisted in denying this claim based solely on the anti-assignment clause, hasn't it?
- **EXHIBITS 14, 15, 16, 17**
- **EXHIBIT 1** - Position unchanged
- **EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer provision (continued reliance)

Q: That's Acuity's position right up until this trial, correct?

---

## X. FINAL COMMITMENTS - POWER CLOSE (2-3 min)

**The Trilogy:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, you never researched Missouri law before denying this $1.5 million claim, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4** - No research
- **EXHIBIT 6** - $4.5M value

Q: You never investigated the specific circumstances of this assignment, did you?
- **EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You never gave the insured or assignee an opportunity to address your concerns, did you?
- **EXHIBITS 15, 16** - They demanded communication

**[PAUSE]**

**The Timeline:**

Q: For four months, you treated this as a covered claim, correct?
- **EXHIBITS 5, 10** - January-April cooperation

Q: You made payments, you hired experts, you coordinated repairs, didn't you?
- **EXHIBITS 5, 6, 8, 9, 10**

Q: Then the claim was assigned, and you immediately stopped paying, correct?
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Assignment
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Payment cessation

Q: The loss didn't change, did it?
- **EXHIBIT 6**

Q: The policy didn't change, correct?
- **EXHIBITS 25, 26, 27, 28** - Same policy provisions

Q: The only thing that changed was who was asking for the money, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 13**

**Final Commitment:**

Q: A reasonable insurance company, faced with a $1.5 million claim in Missouri involving a post-loss assignment, would research Missouri law before denying that claim, wouldn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - $4.5M claim

**[PAUSE]**

Q: But Acuity didn't do that, did you?
- **EXHIBITS 1, 4**

**Ultimate Question:**

Q: In fact, Mr. Jostes, the real reason Acuity denied this claim was to avoid paying $4.5 million, wasn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6** - $4.5M vs. **EXHIBIT 7** - $1.46M reserve

**[If objection sustained]**

Q: Acuity had a financial interest in not paying this claim, didn't it?
- **EXHIBIT 6 vs. 7** - $3M overage

Q: And Acuity acted on that financial interest by denying the claim based on the assignment, correct?
- **EXHIBITS 1, 13**

**[END WITH SILENCE]**

| Exhibit | Policy Provision | Contradiction/Coverage Created |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **22** | Requirement for Sprinklers | Requires sprinklers but denies repair coverage |
| **23** | Coverage for Damage to Property of Others | Post-assignment = property of others = coverage |
| **24** | Pay for Sprinkler Systems | Explicitly covers sprinklers (contradicts denial EXHIBIT 9) |
| **25** | Transfer/Assignment clause | Acuity's sole basis for denial |
| **26** | Appraisal provision | Value dispute mechanism (not coverage dispute) |
| **26B** | Appraisal (variant) | Confirms appraisal process |
| **27** | Property Damage definition | "Physical injury + resulting loss" = fire suppression covered |
| **28** | Coverage for Printers (endorsement) | Shows policy provides specialized coverage |

## POLICY CONTRADICTION THEMES

### Theme 1: Fire Suppression Contradiction

**Coverage-Creating Language:**
- **EXHIBIT 22** - Policy REQUIRES sprinklers
- **EXHIBIT 24** - Policy will PAY for sprinkler damage
- **EXHIBIT 27** - "Resulting loss" from physical injury = covered
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Newman included sprinklers in covered scope ($114,700)

**Coverage-Denying Action:**
- **EXHIBIT 9** - Jostes: "out-of-pocket expense, no coverage"

**Cross-Examination Flow:**
1. Show policy requires sprinklers (EXHIBIT 22)
2. Show policy pays for sprinklers (EXHIBIT 24)
3. Show Newman estimated sprinklers as covered (EXHIBIT 6)
4. Confront with denial (EXHIBIT 9)
5. Force admission: Contradictory

### Theme 2: Post-Loss Assignment

**Coverage-Creating Argument:**
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Assignment 5 months AFTER loss
- **EXHIBIT 27** - Loss occurred at moment of physical injury (January 20)
- **EXHIBIT 23** - Property of others coverage applies
- **Missouri Law** - Post-loss assignments valid

**Coverage-Denying Basis:**
- **EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer provision (anti-assignment clause)
- **EXHIBIT 1** - Acuity's sole basis

**Cross-Examination Flow:**
1. Establish post-loss timing (EXHIBITS 13, 15)
2. Show property damage definition (EXHIBIT 27)
3. Show property of others coverage (EXHIBIT 23)
4. Show Acuity never researched Missouri law (EXHIBITS 1, 4)
5. Force admission: Denial based on unresearched legal position

### Theme 3: Appraisal Sequence Reversal

**Policy-Mandated Sequence:**
- **EXHIBIT 26** - "If we disagree on value → appraisal"
- **EXHIBIT 26** - "We retain right to deny AFTER appraisal"
- Proper order: Value dispute → Appraise → Pay → Retain right to deny coverage

**Actual Sequence:**
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Assignment notice (June)
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Immediate denial (June)
- **EXHIBITS 14, 15, 16** - Appraisal demands came AFTER denial

**Cross-Examination Flow:**
1. Read appraisal provision (EXHIBIT 26)
2. Establish it's for VALUE disputes, not coverage
3. Show policy says "retain right to deny" (implies pay first)
4. Prove actual sequence reversed (deny first, appraisal demands later)
5. Force admission: Violated policy sequence

### Theme 4: Property Damage Definition

**Broad Definition Creates Coverage:**
- **EXHIBIT 27** - "Physical injury to tangible property"
- **EXHIBIT 27** - "INCLUDING all resulting loss of use"
- **EXHIBIT 27** - "All such loss shall be deemed to occur at time of physical injury"

**Application to This Case:**
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Roof collapse = physical injury ✓
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Sprinkler damage FROM roof collapse = resulting loss ✓
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Fire suppression estimated as part of covered loss ✓

**Cross-Examination Flow:**
1. Read definition aloud (EXHIBIT 27)
2. Show roof collapse is physical injury (EXHIBIT 6)
3. Show sprinkler damage resulted from collapse (EXHIBIT 4)
4. Force admission: Fits policy definition
5. Confront with denial (EXHIBIT 9)

## STRATEGIC NOTES

### Sequencing Chapters

**Safe to Risky:**
- Chapters I-II: Safe (build control)
- Chapter III: Transition (denial timing)
- Chapters IV-V: Confrontational (failures/contradictions)
- Chapter VI: Policy contradictions (NEW - uses policy language)
- Chapters VII-VIII: Aggressive (motive/investigation)
- Chapters IX-X: Power close (trilogy + commitments)

### Using Policy Exhibits

**When to Show Policy:**
- Chapter VI: Policy contradiction chapter (primary use)
- Throughout: Reference policy provisions to show Acuity's selective enforcement

**How to Handle:**
- Have policy sections tabbed and ready
- Read provision aloud first
- Then show exhibit to witness
- Force admission: policy says X
- Then confront: but you did Y

### Cross-Reference Strategy

**Link Policy to Facts:**
- EXHIBIT 27 (definition) + EXHIBIT 6 (damage estimate) = coverage
- EXHIBIT 22 (requires sprinklers) + EXHIBIT 24 (pays for sprinklers) vs. EXHIBIT 9 (denies coverage)
- EXHIBIT 26 (appraisal first) vs. EXHIBITS 14, 15, 16 (denial first, appraisal demands later)
- EXHIBIT 25 (transfer clause) + Missouri law = invalid basis
