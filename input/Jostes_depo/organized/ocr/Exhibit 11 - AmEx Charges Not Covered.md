Hi Dave,

The blankets belong to American Express. Attached (btm of email) is the invoice I sent you before showing the address and cost. Also attached is the breakdown of the damaged blanket kits. Bill Nottke sourced the plastic bags and found a vendor that can make the printed boxes that were damaged. Total unusable kits is 937.

I will get the Jergen's info next week.

I'd like to get the anti fatigue mats as soon as we can as my workers are standing on concrete all day and have been working without.

Thanks,

Mark Gray

Mark,

I was communicating with Bill yesterday about other issues and did not get a chance to address your most recent email with him. Couple things here.

ACUITY 0698

Page 2 of 4

As you know, Bill told me that he would be able to salvage many of these items. Bill said he would have some information for me in a couple weeks. I cannot address any of the AMEX stuff until I know what we can save and what is lost. Additionally, I was under the assumption that the blankets/packaging were products that you produced and provided to your customer. Based on your most recent emails, it appears that they belong to either Color Art, or American Express. Can you clarify this. The policy requires that we pay the owner of the property that was damaged. Please see policy language below.

# A. COVERAGE 

## 1. Covered Property

c. Personal Property of Others that is:
(1) In your care, custody or control; and
(2) Located in or on the building or structure described in the Declarations or in the open (or in a vehicle) within 100 feet of the building or structure or within 100 feet of the premises described in the Declarations, whichever distance is greater.
However, our payment for loss of or damage to personal property of others will only be for the account of the owner of the property.

Regarding Jergens items, my inventory list from Servpro does not list any Jergens items. You mentioned them in your $2 / 23$ email but I did not address as we were still working through the blanket situation. Similar to the blankets, who is the owner of these items. If a customer owns the items, I need to issue payment directly to them. The policy requires we pay the owners directly so they cannot make a claim against this policy in the future by saying they were not paid for their items.

Please let me know if there are any other Business Personal Property (BPP) items or customer items that were not on the list.

At this point, I am aware of the blankets, the antifatigue mats, the Jergens products, and the cardboard items. If Bill can provide the number of blankets he can repackage, I can issue a payment to the owners for the balance of the blankets that were lost. Bill will provide an invoice for the work to repackage the salvaged items and I will pay him directly for that work. I can also issue a separate payment for the Jergens items once I know who the owner is, and I can issue a third payment to Riverdale Packaging Corp for the items that they lost which appear to be the mats and the cardboard. Bill was also going to look and confirm there were no other damaged BPP items.

So, the answer to your question is I can issue a payment once I have all the information I mentioned above. As I don't know how long it will take to collect all that information, I really can't give you a date. I guess you could send them all the blankets/packaging that were not damaged. Once I hear back from Bill on the salvaged items I can figure out what we owe them (\# of blankets x unit cost) and send them a payment.

Please advised if you have any questions or concerns.

Dave,

I didn't get a response on my below email.

I need to give them an update as they are hounding me.

Hi Dave,

My American Express customer keeps bugging me. I need to give him an update on the blanket boxes and when they can expect reimbursement? Bill Nottke told me he was going to try to replicate the boxes and plastic sleeves? I just need to give them a timeframe on all of this. Same with the Jergen's product.

I'm not as concerned with the other stuff except the anti fatigue mats as my workers are asking about them.

Attached (btm of email) is another invoice I paid for the emergency water shut off that your initial guy that came out called to find and shut off the main water at the street.

Thanks,

Hi Dave,

I sent the info on the blankets to my customer (Color Art) who talked to their customer (American Express).

He sent me the attached invoice (btm of email) and response:

Here is what I got back on costs (attached).

I also asked my AEXP contact about the boxes damaged but not the blankets and they will not deal with the piece meal aspect. The product that comes from Sferra is considered one item in the box and in the plastic. They cannot remanufacture the boxes - these are all procured in Portugal. Based on what they show are they saying 1681 units have

issues? If that is the case AXP is going to want the # of pieces $32 ea.

Let me know next steps.

Also attached:

- The original invoices for the anti fatigue mats.
- Invoice for the cardboard sheets (which are 87" x 67" x 3/16")

The 24 damaged Jergens product:

Product is $10.99 each. Here is a link they sent for product pricing confirmation.

- The Awaken Essential Oil Sticks retail for $10.99 each: https://mykaoshop.com/products/jergens-essential-oil-awaken-balm-stick
