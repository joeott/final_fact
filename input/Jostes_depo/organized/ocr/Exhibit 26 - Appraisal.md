## COMMERCIAL PROPERTY COVERAGE PART

A. When this endorsement is attached to the Standard Property Policy CP 0099 the terms Coverage Form and Coverage Part in this endorsement are replaced by the term Policy.
B. The following provision replaces paragraph c of the Loss Payment Loss Condition in the Commercial Property Coverage Part:
In the event of loss or damage covered under this Coverage Part, we will give you notice, within 15 working days after we receive a properly executed proof of loss, that we:

1. Accept your claim;
2. Deny your claim; or
3. Need more time to determine whether your claim should be accepted or denied.
If we deny your claim, such notice will be in writing, and will state any policy provision, condition or exclusion used as a basis for the denial.
If we need more time to determine whether your claim should be accepted or denied, the written notice will state the reason(s) why more time is needed.
If we have not completed our investigation, we will notify you again in writing, within 45 days after the date the initial notice is sent informing you that we need more time to determine whether your claim should be accepted or denied and thereafter every 45 days. The written notice shall state why more time is needed to investigate your claim.
C. Except as provided in E below, the Appraisal Loss Condition is replaced by the following:

## APPRAISAL

If we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within 20 days of the written demand for appraisal. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, then, upon your or our request, an umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state and county (or city if the city is not within a county) in which the property covered is located. The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. The umpire shall make an award within 30 days after the umpire
receives the appraisers' submissions of their differences. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding.
Each party will:

1. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.
If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.
