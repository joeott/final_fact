Chad, we are still in the process of determining the exact scope and cost of repair. We had initial engineering drawings and then the local building department came in with additional requests. I believe there is an architect producing plans as we speak. We have a general budget, but there will be some additions. I also believe that the roof trust materials have been ordered but will take some time to receive. The interior office repairs are ongoing and will likely be completed prior to the exterior building repairs. There are still outstanding bids for the fire suppression system and code requirements from the city are still unknown.

There does not appear to be a loss of business income at this time. Initial contents payment has been issued.

Best regards,

Dave Jostes
