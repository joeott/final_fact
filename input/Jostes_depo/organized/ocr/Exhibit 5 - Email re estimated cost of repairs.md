Kevin Thole is the owner of Servpro who we have reached out to for emergency assistance, and potentially building repair. We have contacted Kevin because we have worked with him in St. Louis on other commercial insurance losses with good results. Ultimately, Kevin's company will be working for you. You are the owner of the property and control any work that is done. You will also be the person who contracts with Servpro as the building owner. Acuity's role in this event as the insurer is to reach agreements with all parties involved regarding scope of damage and cost of repair. We will issue all payments for work and costs that we have agreed upon with the goal of putting you back to pre-loss condition.

I have not provided Kevin's info as they will assign a project manager who will likely be the point of contact. Kevin will provide his info and their info when he reaches out to you to discuss the project.

Currently, the plan is for Servpro is:

1. Today, get out to the site, address any emergency health and safety issues, and provide a plan for any necessary mitigation, to stabilize the property.
2. Install a temporary wall around the collapsed area of the warehouse so that work can continue in the undamaged portion of the warehouse.
3. Work with the building consultant and structural engineer to determine the scope of repair for the building and cost of those repairs.

Tom Celosky BC and Joe Kraus SE plan to inspect the building early next week (TBD). They will reach out to you to confirm date and time.

I plan to inspect the building late this week or early next week depending on Servpro's findings at their inspection. If I need to be out on Friday I will be. If not, I will plan to inspect with Tom and Joe early next week.

If I have misspoken regarding the plan moving forward or any details, please reply to the group and correct them. The same goes for any additional information I may have missed.

I can generally be reached by phone, text, or email.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
