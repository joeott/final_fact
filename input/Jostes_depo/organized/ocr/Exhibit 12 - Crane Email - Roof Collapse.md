Hi Dave,

I just spoke with Brian Sondrol on the roof collapse for our insured Riverdale Packaging. I was on site yesterday with the owner and fire department and took attached pictures. I know you just got assigned to this large claim so let us know once you get your arms around it. I've included our internal claims department at Crane who will be following this claim through.

The contact for this claim is Mark at 314-249-5884 or mgray@custommidwest.com.

Thanks!

Please email gellnerservice@craneagency.com for any certificate, MVR, or auto/equipment/driver changes, Thanks!
