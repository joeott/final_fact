I think we need to add Riverdale Packaging Corp to the Insurance Benefits Assignment Agreement since the insurance policy may be in that name. See attached revised document. I will not have time to send out an email with all the closing documents today. I will send it out to you over the weekend.

Mr. Brian C. West, Esq.,

Good morning, I hope this message finds you well. As discussed yesterday, June 6, 2024 we have concerns the insurance company (Acuity) may attempt to not accept our valid assignment of claim. In an abundance of caution, in order to avoid any and all litigation with Acuity, we want to take the simple step of requesting your client, Riverdale Packaging Corporation, invoke appraisal to resolve the claim. Appraisal is a provision intended to be utilized to avoid legal disputes as it is a form of alternative dispute resolution. The appraisal provision can be found in the policy on page

Page 4 of 7

28 of 301 of the PDF, with a footer labeling of "page 4 of 16 " in the property insurance section.

The appraisal provision reads as follows:
2. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will:
a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.
If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

The appraisal process requires uninvolved, disinterested, third-parties set the value of loss which closes the claim and makes the amount set final and binding. As discussed, we believe the insurer owes for a full roof replacement which would alleviate considerable financial burdens we will face in reconstructing and repairing the building. We just want the insurance company to pay for what they actually owe.

You will note in the demand for appraisal document, we identify the appraiser as Ron

Page 5 of 7

Williamson, a seasoned and well respected, national appraiser.

We request this document be signed and submitted to the insurance company by your client at closing as we anticipate Acuity denying the valid assignment, which we would rather not challenge. We would rather allow an appraisal panel set the amount of loss and close the claim. I want to again reiterate per our call, we just want a simple, smooth transaction. We are anti-litigation that is why we propose this method of resolution. With that stated, we still want the insurer to pay for what they owe in relation to the loss sustained which they have left out critical structural components of the repair and ISO board (insulation board).

We will sit in the shoes of your client in bearing all costs associated with the appraisal as we have a valid binding assignment between our companies upon the execution of the PSA.

I tried to make this document as simple as possible (one page) and have attached a PDF and word doc for the ease of editing.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
