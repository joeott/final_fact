Q: The claim number was SG6882, correct?
**EXHIBITS 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11**

Q: The date of loss was January 20, 2024, wasn't it?
**EXHIBITS 15, 6**

**EXHIBITS 4, 10**

---

## II. POLICY PROVIDES COLLAPSE COVERAGE (4-5 min)

### **A. Additional Coverage for Collapse Provision**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy has a section titled "Additional Coverage - Collapse," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 20** - Page 3

Q: That provision defines "abrupt collapse" as "an abrupt falling down or caving in of a building," correct?
**EXHIBIT 20** - Chunk 9: "abrupt collapse means an abrupt falling down or caving in of a building"

Q: The policy states it will pay for "direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property, caused by abrupt collapse," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 20** - Chunk 9

Q: Covered causes of collapse include "Weight of rain that collects on a roof," correct?
**EXHIBIT 20** - Chunk 9: "2d(5) Weight of rain that collects on a roof"

Q: The Riverdale warehouse roof collapsed because of weight on the roof, didn't it?
**EXHIBIT 6** - Newman Report (roof collapse from weight)
**EXHIBIT 4** - Claim log

Q: Heavy snow and ice accumulated on the roof in January 2024, correct?
**EXHIBIT 4** - Claim log: weather conditions

Q: That weight caused the roof to collapse, didn't it?
**EXHIBIT 6**

Q: So the policy's Additional Coverage - Collapse provision applies to this loss, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 20** - Provision language + **EXHIBIT 6** - Actual loss

Q: Yet you never cited this coverage provision when setting your $1.46 million reserve, did you?
**EXHIBIT 7** - Reserve report (no mention of Collapse coverage provision)

Q: You never told the insured, "Don't worry, we have specific collapse coverage," did you?
**EXHIBIT 10** - No such communication

Q: You simply treated it as general property coverage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 7**

### **B. Water Damage Coverage Extension**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy has a "Water Or Other Liquid, Powder Or Molten Material Damage" coverage extension, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 21** - Chunk 1: "Water Or Other Liquid, Powder Or Molten Material Damage"

Q: That provision states: "If loss or damage caused by or resulting from covered water... occurs, we will also pay the cost to tear out and replace any part of the building or structure to repair damage to the system or appliance from which the water... escapes," correct?
**EXHIBIT 21** - Chunk 1

Q: The sprinkler system pipes were damaged in the collapse, weren't they?
**EXHIBIT 4** - Claim log: "roof collapsed causing damage to sprinkler system"
**EXHIBIT 6** - Sprinkler damage

Q: Water and antifreeze escaped from the damaged sprinkler pipes, didn't it?
**EXHIBIT 4**

Q: So the policy's water damage coverage extension applies, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 21** - Coverage for system from which liquid escapes

Q: That provision says you'll pay to "tear out and replace any part of the building... to repair damage to the system," correct?
**EXHIBIT 21**

Q: Yet you denied coverage for the fire suppression system repairs, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 9** - "out-of-pocket expense, no coverage"

---

## III. POLICY REQUIRES AND PAYS FOR SPRINKLERS (5-6 min)

### **A. Mandatory Sprinkler Requirement**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy has a "Protective Safeguards" endorsement, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Title

Q: That endorsement states: "As a condition of this insurance, you are required to: Maintain the protective devices... in complete working order," correct?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Chunk 0

Q: The Schedule identifies "P-1" as "Automatic Sprinkler System," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Chunk 1: "P-1" Automatic Sprinkler System
**EXHIBIT 22** - Chunk 3: Schedule shows P-1 applies to premises

Q: So the policy REQUIRES Riverdale to maintain an operational sprinkler system, correct?
**EXHIBIT 22**

Q: The policy defines "Automatic Sprinkler System" to include "sprinklers and discharge nozzles," "ducts, pipes, valves and fittings," and "tanks... and supports," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Chunk 1: Complete system definition

Q: That's the entire sprinkler infrastructure, correct?

Q: The policy states that failure to maintain the sprinkler system could void coverage for FIRE, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Chunk 2: "We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from fire if, prior to the fire, you failed to comply"

Q: So the policy treats the sprinkler system as absolutely essential to coverage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 22**

### **B. Policy Pays for Sprinkler Repairs**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy also has a "Fire Extinguisher Systems Recharge Expense" additional coverage, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Chunk 2: Title

Q: That provision states: "We will pay... the cost of recharging or replacing... your fire extinguishers and fire extinguishing systems," correct?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Chunk 2

Q: It covers "loss or damage to Covered Property if such loss or damage is the result of an accidental discharge of chemicals from a fire extinguisher or a fire extinguishing system," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Chunk 2

Q: The policy will pay up to $25,000 for such loss or damage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Chunk 2: "$25,000 in any one occurrence"

Q: So the policy explicitly provides coverage for damage FROM the fire suppression system, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 24**

### **C. The Contradiction**

Q: Let me make sure I understand the policy:
- The policy REQUIRES you to maintain sprinklers, correct?
**EXHIBIT 22**

Q: The policy will VOID fire coverage if sprinklers aren't maintained, correct?
**EXHIBIT 22**

Q: The policy explicitly PAYS for fire extinguishing system damage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 24**

Q: Yet when the roof collapse damaged the sprinkler system, you denied coverage for repairing it, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 9** - "Fire suppression... out-of-pocket expense, no coverage"

Q: That's contradictory, isn't it?
**EXHIBIT 22 + 24** (requires and pays) vs. **EXHIBIT 9** (denies)

Q: You're telling the insured: "You MUST have working sprinklers, but we WON'T pay to fix them when they're damaged by a covered loss"?
**EXHIBITS 22, 24 vs. 9**

Q: That makes no sense, does it?

Q: In fact, the policy specifically contemplates paying for sprinkler damage, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Up to $25,000

Q: Newman's estimate for fire suppression was $114,700, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 6** - Lines 17-18

Q: That's well within the scope of what the policy covers, correct?
**EXHIBIT 24** ($25,000) + **EXHIBIT 20** (collapse coverage) + **EXHIBIT 21** (water damage) = comprehensive coverage

Q: Yet you denied it entirely, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 9**

---

## IV. PROPERTY DAMAGE DEFINITION CREATES COVERAGE (4-5 min)

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy defines "property damage" as "physical injury to tangible property, INCLUDING all resulting loss of use of that property," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 27** - Chunk 0: Exact definition

Q: The definition says "All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it," correct?
**EXHIBIT 27**

Q: The word "INCLUDING" in that definition is broad language, isn't it?

Q: It means "resulting loss of use" is part of covered property damage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 27**

Q: The roof collapse was physical injury to tangible property, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 6** - Physical damage documented

Q: The sprinkler system was damaged as a result of the roof collapse, correct?
**EXHIBIT 4** - "roof collapsed causing damage to sprinkler system"

Q: So the sprinkler damage was "resulting loss of use" from the physical injury to the roof, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 27** - Definition + **EXHIBIT 4** - Causal chain

Q: Under the policy's own definition, that's covered property damage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 27**

Q: Yet you denied coverage for the sprinkler repairs, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 9**

Q: That contradicts the policy's property damage definition, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 27** (broad definition) vs. **EXHIBIT 9** (narrow denial)

---

## V. TRANSFER PROVISION REQUIRES WRITTEN CONSENT (3-4 min)

### **A. The Policy Language**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy has a section titled "Transfer Of Your Rights And Duties Under This Policy," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 25** - Chunk 3

Q: That provision states: "Your rights and duties under this policy may not be transferred without our written consent," correct?
**EXHIBIT 25** - Chunk 3: Exact language

Q: But that provision has an exception, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 25** - "except in the case of death"

Q: The full language is: "except in the case of death of an individual named insured," isn't it?
**EXHIBIT 25**

Q: If the named insured dies, rights transfer to the legal representative WITHOUT requiring Acuity's written consent, correct?
**EXHIBIT 25** - Death exception

### **B. What Actually Happened**

Q: Riverdale Packaging didn't die, did it?

Q: Riverdale sold the property to Allstates Equity Group, correct?
**EXHIBIT 13** - Property sale/assignment

Q: That was a voluntary commercial transaction, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 13, 14**

Q: Riverdale assigned its insurance claim rights to Allstates, didn't it?
**EXHIBIT 13**

Q: You never gave written consent to that transfer, did you?
**EXHIBIT 4** - No consent documented

Q: That's why you denied the claim, correct?
**EXHIBIT 1** - Sole basis: anti-assignment clause
**EXHIBIT 25** - The clause you relied on

### **C. Post-Loss Timing**

Q: The loss occurred January 20, 2024, correct?
**EXHIBIT 15**

Q: The assignment happened in June 2024, didn't it?
**EXHIBIT 13**

Q: That's 5 months AFTER the loss, correct?
**[5-month gap]**

Q: The policy language says "your rights and duties... may not be transferred," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 25**

Q: It doesn't say "the CLAIM may not be transferred," does it?
**EXHIBIT 25** - Says "rights and duties"

Q: After a loss occurs, the insured's "duty" to notify you is already completed, isn't it?
**EXHIBIT 15** - Notice given January 21
**EXHIBIT 25** - Duties completed

Q: After a loss occurs and notice is given, what remains is just the RIGHT to payment, correct?
**EXHIBIT 25** - Rights vs. duties

Q: The policy language about transferring "rights AND duties" contemplates pre-loss transfers, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 25** - Duties only exist before loss

Q: But you never researched whether Missouri law distinguishes pre-loss from post-loss assignments, did you?
**EXHIBIT 4** - No legal research

---

## VI. THE ASSIGNMENT AND ABRUPT DENIAL (4-5 min)

Q: You received notice of the assignment in June 2024, correct?
**EXHIBIT 13**

Q: After receiving that notice, you stopped making payments, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You didn't conduct any investigation of the assignment's validity, did you?
**EXHIBIT 4**

Q: The loss facts hadn't changed, correct?

Q: The roof was still collapsed, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 6**

Q: The policy provisions hadn't changed, had they?
**EXHIBITS 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27** - Same policy

Q: The only thing that changed was who was asking for the money, correct?
**EXHIBIT 13**

Q: You denied the claim based solely on the Transfer provision, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 1** - Sole basis
**EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer provision

Q: You never questioned whether the collapse was covered, did you?
**EXHIBIT 7** - "Coverage Issues: None"
**EXHIBIT 20** - Additional Coverage Collapse provision (applies to this loss)

Q: You never questioned whether sprinkler damage was covered, did you - until you looked for a way to reduce the claim, correct?
**EXHIBITS 5, 6** - Initially included vs. **EXHIBIT 9** - Later denied

---

## VII. FIRE SUPPRESSION - POLICY CONTRADICTIONS (6-7 min)

### **A. Policy REQUIRES Sprinklers**

Q: Mr. Jostes, the policy requires Riverdale to maintain an "Automatic Sprinkler System," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Protective Safeguards requirement

Q: The Schedule specifically designates both buildings as requiring "P-1" sprinkler systems, correct?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Chunk 3: Schedule shows Premises 001/Building 001: P-1; Premises 002/Building 001: P-1

Q: The policy states you're "required to Maintain the protective devices... in complete working order," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Chunk 0

Q: If Riverdale failed to maintain the sprinklers, you could deny a fire claim, couldn't you?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Chunk 2: "We will not pay for loss... caused by... fire if... you failed to comply"

Q: So the policy makes sprinklers a CONDITION of coverage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 22**

### **B. Policy PAYS for Sprinkler Damage**

Q: The policy also provides "Fire Extinguisher Systems Recharge Expense" coverage, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Chunk 2: Title

Q: That provision states: "We will pay the cost of recharging or replacing... your fire extinguishers and fire extinguishing systems," correct?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Chunk 2

Q: It covers "loss or damage to Covered Property if such loss or damage is the result of an accidental discharge... from a fire extinguishing system," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Chunk 2

Q: The policy will pay up to $25,000 for such damage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 24** - Chunk 2

Q: So the policy EXPLICITLY provides coverage for fire extinguishing/sprinkler system damage, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 24**

### **C. Water Damage Extension Covers Sprinkler Leaks**

Q: The policy's water damage coverage extension states: "we will also pay the cost to tear out and replace any part of the building or structure to repair damage to the system or appliance from which the water... escapes," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 21** - Chunk 1

Q: When the roof collapsed, sprinkler pipes were damaged and water escaped, correct?
**EXHIBIT 4** - Claim log description

Q: So the water damage extension applies to repairing the sprinkler system, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 21**

### **D. Collapse Coverage Includes Resulting Damage**

Q: The policy's collapse provision covers "direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property, caused by abrupt collapse," correct?
**EXHIBIT 20** - Chunk 9

Q: "Covered Property" includes the building and its systems, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 20, 22** - Building and sprinklers both covered

Q: The sprinkler system is part of the building, isn't it?
**EXHIBIT 22** - Defined as building protective safeguard

Q: So collapse coverage includes damage to the sprinkler system, correct?
**EXHIBIT 20** - Broad coverage for collapse damage

### **E. The Contradiction**

Q: Let me make sure I understand Acuity's position:

Q: The policy REQUIRES working sprinklers, correct?
**EXHIBIT 22**

Q: The policy PAYS for sprinkler damage (up to $25,000), correct?
**EXHIBIT 24**

Q: The policy PAYS for water damage from damaged systems, correct?
**EXHIBIT 21**

Q: The policy COVERS collapse damage to building and its systems, correct?
**EXHIBIT 20**

Q: Yet when the collapse damaged the sprinklers, you said "no coverage," didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 9**

Q: That contradicts FOUR separate policy provisions, doesn't it?
**EXHIBITS 20, 21, 22, 24** vs. **EXHIBIT 9**

Q: You never explained to the insured which of these four provisions doesn't apply, did you?

Q: You never explained HOW these provisions don't cover sprinkler damage from a covered collapse, did you?

Q: You simply said "no coverage per the policy," correct?
**EXHIBIT 9**

Q: But that's not what the policy says, is it?
**EXHIBITS 20, 21, 22, 24** - All provide coverage

### **F. Newman's Estimate Was Based on Policy Coverage**

Q: Newman Construction Consulting estimated $114,700 for fire suppression repairs, didn't they?
**EXHIBIT 6** - Lines 17-18

Q: Newman also estimated over $1 million in code-required sprinkler upgrades, correct?
**EXHIBIT 6**

Q: Newman was working on YOUR behalf as Acuity's consultant, wasn't he?
**EXHIBIT 5** - You hired Newman

Q: Newman included sprinklers in the covered loss estimate because the policy covers it, didn't he?
**EXHIBIT 6** + **EXHIBITS 20, 21, 22, 24** - Policy coverage

Q: Yet you later contradicted your own consultant and said no coverage, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 6** (Newman: covered) vs. **EXHIBIT 9** (Jostes: not covered)

---

## VIII. PROPERTY OF OTHERS COVERAGE (3-4 min)

### **[Note: Exhibit 23 - Coverage for Damage to Property of Others was not loaded to Neo4j - requires re-processing]**

Q: Mr. Jostes, after the assignment, Allstates Equity Group owned the property, correct?
**EXHIBIT 13** - Property sale

Q: From Riverdale's perspective, it was now "property of others," wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 13**

Q: The policy has a "Coverage for Damage to Property of Others" provision, doesn't it?
**[EXHIBIT 23 - Requires re-processing]**

Q: That provision covers damage to property of others in the insured's care, custody, or control, correct?
**[EXHIBIT 23]**

Q: The warehouse was in Riverdale's care, custody, and control when the collapse occurred, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 15** - Notice (Riverdale was still operating)

Q: So the property of others provision creates coverage, doesn't it?
**[EXHIBIT 23]**

---

## IX. APPRAISAL PROVISION REVERSAL (4-5 min)

### **A. Policy's Intended Sequence**

Q: Mr. Jostes, when you and the insured disagree on the VALUE of property or AMOUNT of loss, the policy provides for appraisal, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 26** - Chunk 1: "If we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss"

Q: The appraisal provision states: "If we and you disagree on the value... either may make written demand for an appraisal," correct?
**EXHIBIT 26**

Q: Each side selects an appraiser, the two appraisers select an umpire, and they determine the value, correct?
**EXHIBIT 26** - Process described

Q: The provision then states: "If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim," doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 26** - Chunk 1: "we will still retain our right to deny the claim"

Q: That language - "we will still RETAIN our right to deny" - contemplates that you would deny AFTER the appraisal determines value, doesn't it?
**EXHIBIT 26**

Q: The policy sequence is: Disagree on value → Appraise → Determine amount owed → THEN retain right to deny coverage, correct?
**EXHIBIT 26**

### **B. What Acuity Actually Did**

Q: But here, you denied coverage BEFORE any appraisal, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 4** - Denial in June
**EXHIBIT 16** - Appraisal demand June 21 (AFTER denial)

Q: The appraisal demands came from Allstates AFTER you'd already stopped paying, didn't they?
**EXHIBITS 14, 15, 16** - All after denial

Q: You never participated in an appraisal to determine the value, did you?
**EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You simply denied the claim based on the assignment, correct?
**EXHIBIT 1**

Q: So you reversed the policy sequence, didn't you?
**Policy order (EXHIBIT 26): value dispute → appraise → pay → retain right to deny**
**Actual order: deny → appraisal demands**

Q: You denied coverage without determining what amount was owed, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 4** - No appraisal conducted before denial

Q: The appraisal provision is for VALUE disputes, not coverage disputes, isn't it?
**EXHIBIT 26** - "value" and "amount of loss"

Q: But you turned this into a coverage dispute by denying based on the assignment, correct?
**EXHIBIT 1, 25**

---

## X. FAILURE TO RESEARCH MISSOURI LAW (5-6 min)

Q: Mr. Jostes, before denying this claim based on the assignment, you didn't research Missouri law on post-loss assignments, did you?
**EXHIBIT 4** - No research notation

Q: You didn't consult with Acuity's legal department, did you?
**EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You didn't read any Missouri case law, correct?
**EXHIBIT 1** - No cases cited

Q: You simply read the Transfer provision and decided to deny, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 1** - Sole basis
**EXHIBIT 25** - Transfer provision

Q: You didn't research whether Missouri distinguishes pre-loss from post-loss assignments, did you?
**EXHIBIT 4**

Q: Acuity doesn't have a written policy on handling post-loss assignments in Missouri, does it?
**EXHIBIT 1** - No policy produced

Q: A reasonable insurance adjuster handling a $4.5 million claim would research Missouri law before denying based on an assignment clause, wouldn't they?
**EXHIBIT 6** - $4,517,112.50

Q: But you didn't do that, did you?
**EXHIBITS 1, 4**

---

## XI. FINANCIAL MOTIVE (3-4 min)

Q: Mr. Jostes, you set reserves of $1,460,000 for this claim, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 7**

Q: The actual repair estimate was $4,517,112.50, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 6**

Q: That's more than three times your reserve, correct?

Q: Denying the claim after assignment eliminated Acuity's obligation to pay $4.5 million, didn't it?

Q: Acuity had a financial interest in finding a reason not to pay this claim, didn't it?

Q: The assignment gave you that reason, correct?
**EXHIBIT 13, 25**

Q: You took that opportunity, didn't you?
**EXHIBIT 4** - Payment cessation

Q: It's fair to say that Acuity benefited financially from denying this claim, isn't it?

---

## XII. CONTINUED DENIAL DESPITE NOTICE (3-4 min)

Q: Allstates's attorney has informed Acuity that Missouri law permits post-loss assignments, hasn't he?
**EXHIBITS 14, 15, 16**

Q: You've been provided with legal authority, haven't you?
**EXHIBIT 17** - Complaint with legal argument

Q: Despite that legal authority, Acuity has maintained its denial, hasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 17** - Declaratory judgment action

Q: Acuity hasn't offered to reconsider, has it?

Q: Acuity continues to deny the claim even today, doesn't it?

Q: So even after being informed of Missouri law, Acuity has persisted in denying this claim based solely on the Transfer provision, hasn't it?
**EXHIBITS 14-17** + **EXHIBIT 25**

---

## XIII. FINAL COMMITMENTS (2-3 min)

### **The Trilogy:**

Q: Mr. Jostes, you never researched Missouri law before denying this $4.5 million claim, did you?
**EXHIBITS 4, 6**

Q: You never investigated the specific circumstances of this assignment, did you?
**EXHIBIT 4**

Q: You never gave the insured an opportunity to address your concerns, did you?
**EXHIBITS 15, 16** - They had to demand communication

**[PAUSE]**

### **The Timeline:**

Q: For four months, you treated this as a covered claim, correct?
**EXHIBITS 5, 10**

Q: You hired experts, coordinated repairs, made payments, didn't you?
**EXHIBITS 5, 6, 8, 9, 10**

Q: Then the assignment happened, and you immediately stopped, correct?
**EXHIBITS 13, 4**

Q: The policy didn't change, did it?
**EXHIBITS 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27**

Q: The loss didn't change, correct?
**EXHIBIT 6**

Q: The only thing that changed was who was asking for the money, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 13**

### **Ultimate Questions:**

Q: A reasonable insurance company would research Missouri law before denying a $4.5 million claim based on a transfer clause, wouldn't it?
**EXHIBITS 6, 25**

**[PAUSE]**

Q: But Acuity didn't do that, did you?
**EXHIBITS 1, 4**

Q: In fact, the real reason Acuity denied this claim was to avoid paying $4.5 million, wasn't it?
**EXHIBIT 6** ($4.5M) vs. **EXHIBIT 7** ($1.46M)

**[END WITH SILENCE]**

## POLICY CONTRADICTION SUMMARY

### **CONTRADICTION 1: Sprinkler Requirement vs. Sprinkler Denial**

**Policy Requires:**
- **EXHIBIT 22** - Must maintain working sprinkler system (P-1 designation)
- **EXHIBIT 22** - Failure voids fire coverage

**Policy Pays:**
- **EXHIBIT 24** - Fire extinguisher recharge/replacement covered
- **EXHIBIT 24** - Up to $25,000 for sprinkler damage

**Acuity Denied:**
- **EXHIBIT 9** - "Fire suppression... out-of-pocket expense, no coverage"

**Contradiction:**
Policy says: Required + We'll pay for it
Acuity says: Not covered

### **CONTRADICTION 2: Broad Property Damage Definition vs. Narrow Denial**

**Policy Provides:**
- **EXHIBIT 27** - "Physical injury to tangible property, INCLUDING all resulting loss of use"
- **EXHIBIT 27** - Resulting loss deemed to occur at time of physical injury

**Facts:**
- **EXHIBIT 6** - Roof collapse = physical injury
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Sprinkler damage FROM collapse = resulting loss

**Policy Creates Coverage:**
- **EXHIBIT 27** - Definition satisfied (physical injury + resulting loss)

**Acuity Denied:**
- **EXHIBIT 9** - Sprinkler repairs "no coverage"

**Contradiction:**
Policy's own definition creates coverage
Acuity denied coverage

### **CONTRADICTION 3: Multiple Coverage Provisions vs. Total Denial**

**Policy Provides Coverage Through:**
1. **EXHIBIT 20** - Additional Coverage Collapse (collapse damage covered)
2. **EXHIBIT 21** - Water Damage Extension (system leaks covered)
3. **EXHIBIT 22** - Sprinkler Requirement (essential to policy)
4. **EXHIBIT 24** - Fire Extinguisher Recharge (sprinkler damage covered)
5. **EXHIBIT 27** - Property Damage Definition (resulting loss included)

**Acuity Denied ALL Coverage:**
- **EXHIBIT 9** - Total denial for fire suppression

**Contradiction:**
Five separate policy provisions create coverage
Acuity cited zero policy provisions supporting denial

### **CONTRADICTION 4: Transfer Language vs. Post-Loss Timing**

**Policy Language:**
- **EXHIBIT 25** - "Your rights and duties... may not be transferred"
- **EXHIBIT 25** - Contemplates pre-loss (when duties still exist)
- **EXHIBIT 25** - Exception for death (shows policy anticipated some transfers)

**Actual Facts:**
- **EXHIBIT 15** - Loss: January 20, 2024
- **EXHIBIT 13** - Assignment: June 2024 (5 months later)
- Post-loss: No duties remaining, only right to payment

**Acuity's Position:**
- **EXHIBIT 1** - Applied transfer clause to post-loss assignment
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Never researched if Missouri law permits this

**Contradiction:**
Policy language contemplates pre-loss transfers (rights AND duties)
Acuity applied it to post-loss transfer (rights only)

### **CONTRADICTION 5: Appraisal Sequence**

**Policy Sequence:**
- **EXHIBIT 26** - VALUE dispute → Appraisal → Determine amount
- **EXHIBIT 26** - "We will still RETAIN our right to deny the claim"
- "Retain" = suggests you pay first, then deny if grounds exist

**Actual Sequence:**
- **EXHIBIT 4** - Acuity denied FIRST (June)
- **EXHIBITS 14, 15, 16** - Appraisal demands came AFTER denial

**Contradiction:**
Policy: Appraise value → Pay → Retain right to deny coverage
Acuity: Deny coverage → Appraisal demanded by insured

---

## CROSS-REFERENCE: POLICY vs. CONDUCT

### **Policy Says → Acuity Did**

| Policy Provision | What It Says | What Acuity Did | Exhibits |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Collapse Coverage** | Covers collapse damage | Set $1.46M reserve, then denied portions | 20, 7, 9 |

## KEY CONTRADICTIONS TO EMPHASIZE

**1. Four Policy Provisions Cover Sprinklers, Acuity Denied All Four:**
- Collapse coverage (EXHIBIT 20)
- Water damage (EXHIBIT 21)
- Sprinkler requirement (EXHIBIT 22)
- Sprinkler payment (EXHIBIT 24)
vs.
- Jostes denial (EXHIBIT 9)

**2. Policy Definition Creates Coverage, Acuity Ignored Definition:**
- "Physical injury INCLUDING resulting loss" (EXHIBIT 27)
- Roof collapse + sprinkler damage = definition satisfied
vs.
- Acuity denied resulting loss (EXHIBIT 9)

**3. Transfer Clause Says "Rights AND Duties," Loss Already Occurred:**
- Policy contemplates pre-loss (when duties exist) (EXHIBIT 25)
- Actual was post-loss (only rights remain, duties completed)
vs.
- Acuity applied without distinguishing (EXHIBIT 1)

**4. Appraisal AFTER Payment, Acuity Denied BEFORE Appraisal:**
- Policy: value dispute → appraise → retain right to deny (EXHIBIT 26)
- Actual: deny → appraisal demands (EXHIBITS 4, 16)
