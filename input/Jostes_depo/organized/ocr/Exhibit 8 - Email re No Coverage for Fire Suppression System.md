Good Morning -
We have received and I have reviewed the ESI Engineering report.
Please find the attached PDF of the ESI Engineering report dated 2/29/24.
It appears the recommendation has changed from our onsite discussion.
Instead of repairing in place bar joist to the East of the ceiling hole, they are now being replaced.
This will increase the foot print of the roof portion repairs.
Please review the information and use this for the bid proposals going forward for but not limited to:
Roofing
Structural Steel
Electrical
Plumbing
HVAC
Fire Suppression
Please provide an update on the Repairs estimate and when we can expect to receive it, onsite progress for other areas of repairs and Abatement.
Please also advise when we can expect to receive the revised Mitigation, which should include ALL in information as Mitigation should be complete.

Morning -
I have reviewed the abatement proposal and am in agreement with the scope of work and value associated.
Please note this is a Not to Exceed number in theory, should scope or costs change I will require a heads up prior to work completed.
Actual accounting will be requested once completed to review scope and costs.

Good morning Tom,
Understood, Thank you for info, I also have attached the estimate from Crossroads.
Let me know if you have questions or concerns.

Anything to-do with contents will be on contents.
Mitigation is just that.
Repairs, obvious.
You should have 3 categories of work.
I followed up with the Engineer last week, we are waiting on his response and report.
But his verbal was replacing structural steel where missing, and repairs to structural steel around the missing.
Meaning the next bay(3) of steel around the whole in the ceiling needs to be repaired. I believe using metal materials and welding back into place.
Post abatement in the office area can and should be written in Xactimate, not bids.
Bids are for specialty contractors and the warehouse.

Good morning Tom
Here is what I have so far,

Page 3 of 5

Asbesto - Cross roads has made proper notice to the city. We are still waiting on the estimate, I just reached out to them today and will have their estimate later today or Monday at the latest.

Mit - Still waiting on receiving invoices from subs. Will pack out and relocation of insured be on mit or recon? I had a crew start on packing out the unoccupied areas of the office. We will be setting up the water intrusion catch basin and pump system, Monday or Tuesday of next week. I hope to have something for you early next week in regards to where the bill is at.

Repairs - Currently receiving bids, was curious if I can get the engineers report when available for the structural repairs needed? This way bids can be based on his recommendations. Unfortunately until Crossroads completes the office area. I won't be able to have any accurate bids. Will have to wait and see the extent of their abatement. I did communicate with the insured that he will be expected to cover all exterior fire suppression system damage and packing lot repairs.

Hope you have a good weekend!

Kevin – thanks for the call and discussion.
Attached are the photos I said I would provide to help make this clear.
We are looking to get electrical isolated from the affected side and operating on the good side.
We are looking to get a framed, insulated wall across the entire length, includes a double door with locking system big enough for a forklift and pallet.
Building manager is aware you guys are being looped in.
Call when onsite or post onsite to discuss a plan.
