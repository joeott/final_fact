## G. DEFINITIONS

1. "Fungus" means any type or form of fungus, including mold or mildew, and any mycotoxins, spores, scents or byproducts produced or released by fungi.
2. "Specified causes of loss" means the following: fire; lightning; explosion; windstorm or hail; smoke; aircraft or vehicles; riot or civil commotion; vandalism; leakage from fire-extinguishing equipment; sinkhole collapse; volcanic action; falling objects; weight of snow, ice or sleet; or water damage.
a. Sinkhole collapse means the sudden sinking or collapse of land into underground empty spaces created by the action of water on limestone or dolomite. This cause of loss does not include:
(1) The cost of filling sinkholes; or
(2) Sinking or collapse of land into man-made underground cavities.
b. Falling objects does not include loss or damage to:
(1) Personal property in the open; or
(2) The interior of a building or structure, or property inside a building or structure, unless the roof or an outside wall of the building or structure is first damaged by a falling object.
c. Water damage means:
(1) Accidental discharge or leakage of water or steam as the direct result of the breaking apart or cracking of a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or other system or appliance (other than a sump system including its related equipment and parts) that is located on the described premises and contains water or steam; and
(2) Accidental discharge or leakage of water or waterborne material as the direct result of the breaking apart or

cracking of a water or sewer pipe caused by wear and tear when the pipe is located off the described premises and is connected to or is part of a potable water supply system or sanitary sewer system operated by a public or private utility service provided or private utility service provider pursuant to authority granted by the state or governmental subdivision where the described premises are located.
But water damage does not include loss or damage otherwise excluded under the terms of the Water Exclusion. Therefore, for example, there is no coverage under this policy in the situation in which discharge or leakage of water results from the breaking apart or cracking of a pipe which was caused by or related to
weather-induced flooding, even if wear and tear contributed to the breakage or cracking. As another example, and also in accordance with the terms of the Water Exclusion, there is no coverage for loss or damage caused by or related to weather-induced flooding which follows or is exacerbated by pipe breakage or cracking attributable to wear and tear.
To the extent that accidental discharge or leakage of water falls within the criteria set forth in $c(1)$ or c(2) of this definition of specified causes of loss, such water is not subject to the provisions of the Water Exclusion which preclude coverage for surface water or water under the surface of the ground.
