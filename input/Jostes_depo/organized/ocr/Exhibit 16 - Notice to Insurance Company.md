See email below that I sent to Acuity last Friday. I have not heard anything from them but I doubt I will. They will probably reach out to Bill Nottke directly. I do not want to receive any insurance proceeds. I have no authority to endorse a check over to you and I do not have a trust fund to receive wire transfers. I will pass along your comments in your recent email to Bill Nottke.

Insured: Riverdale Packaging Corp

Address: 4501 Gustine Ave, St. Louis, MO 63116

Policy Number: ZS1914

Claim Number: SG6882

Mr. Dave Jostes,

Per the policy terms and conditions, we formally invoke appraisal to set the amount of loss.

2. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss, either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding. Each party will: a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally. If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our right to deny the claim.

Our appraiser's contact information is as follows.

Selected Appraiser:

Ron Williamson

(580) 247-0786

Invoke.ron@gmail.com

Please provide your appraiser's contact information no later than June 30, 2024.

Thank you,

Riverdale Packaging Corporation
